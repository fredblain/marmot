The recommendation will be considered today strives to empower the Governing Council 's request for additional foreign reserves , raising the ceiling of 100 billion euros .
So it is simply a matter of principle , the authorization to increase reserves as needed , without the pressure of outside events .
The ECB could , for example , use this procedure to extend them case by case case by case basis , especially during large - scale intervention , but also possibly because of the potential losses on the portfolio , the portfolio re always quarter , according to market rates .
In this context , it should be noted that the entire reserves of the Eurosystem 's become more than â‚¬ 350 billion .
As President Duisenberg was held in his final hearing in the European Parliament , the ECB is not going to intervene in currency markets to influence the external value of the euro .
If another international financial crisis , it is possible to irrational exuberance in the market , could be a need for a concerted intervention by major central banks .
For the ECB could be a party to the agreements , known as the Plaza or Louvre agreements , the Economic and Monetary Affairs seemed obvious to recommend to Parliament vote for the recommendation .
I have not suggested what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues .
Personally , as I said a moment ago , I think Parliament will vote on resolutions too much and that too a number of resolutions to reduce the value of other policy relevant resolutions .
In this case , it is a question by saying yes or no.
A massive yes also send a political message .
We want the ECB to be able to continue its main objective to safeguard price stability in complete independence - the independence of the media .
At the same time , and Duisenberg too evasive for my taste , we also want the European Central Bank system to give unequivocal support to the European Union 's overall economic policy .
We want the Central Bank its share on the international stage and actively promote the new rules , the determination to help the international financial system to operate without crises .
We are confident that the Governing Council will make optimal use of the foreign exchange reserves of the Eurosystem if the tension in the market .
No one argues that the deterrent effect of foreign exchange intervention is proportional to the amount of reserves . However , the more credibility but the opportunity to mobilize more assets at any time , without delay .
It would be justified , however , that such internal transfers of the ECB , which are not included in detail in the Eurosystem 's weekly consolidated financial statement shall be published afterwards .
The European Parliament also requires that the President of the ECB explains the decisions of his Council , when he will appear before the Economic and Monetary indeed the plenary discussions .
So its meaning is not just to satisfy the expectations of the financial markets .
Mr President , I would like to continue from the point where the rapporteur came to a halt in his report , for which I thank him , and to point out once again that , in comparison with a number of resolutions that do not mean with the priorities of the House , increasing foreign reserve assets is an important resolution .
What is the legal basis for today 's debate ?
Article 3 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks , owning and managing foreign reserves is one of the tasks of the ECB .
This task is performed in parallel , the ECB and the national central banks , the national central banks to transfer part of the reserves up to 50 billion euros corresponds to the European Central Bank in accordance with Article 30.1 of the Statute .
It was decided at that time Article 30.4 - that 's why today 's debate comes as no surprise - that the ECB might even say further foreign reserves in excess of the amount set out in Article 30.1 .
This invitation is issued in the form of the Regulation of the EU Council .
The ECB is currently still requires an increase of 50 billion euros .
We , a group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats throughout the Economic and Monetary Affairs , rapporteur has already said , welcome this proposal .
The reasons set out in detail and the time is already on the march , but I would like to say that we believe that this increase is necessary .
First , because it helps to increase the economic independence of the ECB and the independence of the European Central Bank , it is important to ensure the stability and integrity of the currency .
Return on capital paid to date , and official reserves currently represents the ECB 's sole source of income to finance its operations .
We know that it had suffered a loss in 1999 .
We must therefore admit that the lack of funds will take the ECB 's ability to formulate policy independently and transparently .
The funding will be covered so that its independence can not be questioned .
Second , we support this addition , as it helps to develop the ECB 's credibility in the market .
If the ECB is financially independent and self - sufficient , which adds to its credibility in the international market and thereby strengthen the euro on the way to the third stage 1.1.2002 .
Third , this increase will improve the ability of the ECB to react and adapt .
If a serious imbalance in the market , potentially doubling its reserves to the European Central Bank to carry out their tasks in the form of prudential policies more effectively .
It gives him the possibility to react flexibly , because it has the necessary funds available .
Our report also presents other model to strengthen the transparency of this procedure , and I would ask that you vote in addition to book .
Mr President , this draft legislative resolution , the Parliament accepts the Recommendation of the ECB Council regulation on the foreign reserve assets by the central bank .
Following reasons : First , the agreement provides for this .
If you do not apply to the format , this can be interpreted as disagreement with the ECB and the Council .
Third , foreign exchange intervention make it more credible and capacity of the ECB to adapt to the different options can be promoted .
Of course , there can be no such structural improvement of the ECB 's financial situation .
The only question is , is pouring more money it will solve the problem once and for all .
Before the answer can be given to the following questions at least be taken into account :
First of all , it is economically sensible to engage in this kind of tight monetary policy , the ECB is doing is more restrictive than the Federal Reserve ?
Second , the rise in interest rates is not high on the refinancing possibilities and the deposit rate applied 9.2.2000 not conflict with economic growth ?
Third , are crucial measures to reduce unemployment permanently is not the most tested way to ensure price stability ?
Fourth , in addition to supply - oriented economic policies , greater weight can not be demand - orientated economic policy , ie the strengthening of the European internal market by reducing income tax in the Member States ?
Fifth , is it so wrong to assume that the exchange rate of the euro was introduced had more to do with political wishful thinking than economic reality ?
Sixthly , what are the concrete reasons to believe that the ECB is likely to be a loss in 1999 ?
When the answers to these questions , our group seemed to be able to vote the proposal for a resolution .
Not that the ECB has too little foreign exchange reserves , but because it is structurally wrong and , therefore , to complain of the difficulties in paying .
Mr President , the European Central Bank recommends to the Council that it will double its foreign reserves .
To this end , it presents two very different argument .
The first dwell on their own problems , financial management , because the increase in staff to show respect to the income from its assets , revenues could actually hoped would be sufficient to make it self - supporting .
A flash of lucidity , the ECB has announced that the central bank has a structural deficit is simply not credible .
It is true , and it gives rise to some anxiety administrative ability , which so quickly have to raise the ceiling .
Another argument is that the ECB needs to improve its capacity to intervene in the market in general into account depreciation of the euro - in contrast to the soothing predictions have been told that - and the repeated attacks by the economic heart of one of the EU Member State , it must be said , was wise to join the single currency .
It is quite tiring to read in the report that if the political parties - the European Parliament and the Council - refuse to assist the structural improvement in the financial position of the ECB , the latter can no longer be considered to be independent of the market .
It is clear to see that the ECB 's priority lies ; it has received the habit of the decision - makers as a fact , and its main goal is to get the respect of the financial centers to which it seems to hold more value than the confidence of the people .
No , really , we care little whether the ECB or not to double the value of the nuisance .
We would have liked the real part of the self - criticism that are truly responsible , that is , the governments of Fifteen , and the reversal of the policy , which would allow the people to the Member States the opportunity to free themselves from the fate of the standardization , which is prepared for those ill - assorted group is made up of technocrats who believe in the divine right of federalism and globalized speculators .
Goebbels notes that Parliament 's refusal could be interpreted as indicating strongly disagree stability policy of the European Central Bank .
Mr President , we have good reason to be puzzled by the European Central Bank 's request to double the ceiling of the phone calls of foreign reserve assets from the national central banks .
At first sight , it may seem acceptable to raise the current ceiling of 50 billion euros - in fact it is 39.5 billion , as certain countries have not joined the single currency - the EU 's 100 billion when we remember that the national central banks still have EUR 300 billion , its official reserves available .
However , it is found that this must be done as soon as the date when the currency was launched clearly shows that the value of funds seriously underestimated .
With the exception of a few technical explanations relating to details such as the exact number of staff of the ECB , there is only one valid reason can be mentioned : the euro - optimism surrounding the euro , as it was called at that time led people to believe that the money would naturally be strong , and that the question of reserves was thus a secondary .
They all seem to be more and more the reality of now .
But the matter is not yet closed , as the explanatory memorandum to the draft Regulation , as specified in the European Parliament 's report , are rather disturbing , as they do , in passing , that the aim is to raise the ceiling is , and I quote , to improve the bank 's " ability to adapt to different situations . "
Since this does not refer to a scenario where the value of the euro will rise - if that were the case , there would obviously be no need for other funds - it must mean a situation in which its value decreases .
European Parliament 's report is even more pessimistic when it refers to as many words possible instability of the euro according to which the rapporteur is to be demonstrated .
This slip will no doubt displease Duisenberg , who in his turn , must be repeated on a daily basis , that the euro is basically stable .
Still , it is a revealing slip of the tongue .
It is in fact not realistic to believe that an artificial currency can inspire the same confidence in the currency solidly among the people .
The Commission has consulted the Council - as it has been in Parliament - about a recommendation from the European Central Bank concerning further calls of foreign reserve assets to the ECB .
The Commission has expressed its opinion on the recommendation of March 8 , which reads as follows : " states ' rights , as well as the initiative of the Commission and the ECB , the Commission has agreed to the initiative of the European Central Bank .
The Commission will support the doubling of the limit for calls of foreign reserve assets the ECB to the extent that these new requirements serve to replenish holdings of foreign exchange reserves up to an initial limit of EUR 50 billion set in the rule . "
The Commission has adopted a positive opinion on recommendation from the ECB .
If Parliament approves the report of the Goebbels in its current form , this would mean that the Parliament and the Commission 's views converge , which I would be happy .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 in the morning
( The sitting was closed at 19:35 )
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
The minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Mr President , last night , we were faced with unwelcome news for EDF ( German TV channel ) that Hombach , the EU envoy to the Balkans , is placed in re - examine the prosecution .
We have already received serious these types of problems to contend with , since the previous Commission , but in this case , the accusation has been leveled that the DM 300 000 allegedly paid to the Agency 's nothing being received in return .
I urge you to keep the Council informed of this , and to urge it to Hombach all his duties until the investigation has been definitely and legally valid manner .
Panemme noticeable bad kommenttinne , Zimmer Ling .
Yesterday evening , after the vote in the Chamber , the comment that I want to disassociate themselves and not to join .
There was an error in the interpretation and Members of Parliament do not refer to the Technical Group technical group of racists .
This was an unfair comment .
No one could , by the wildest imagination , consider one of Emma Bonino racist .
People need to be careful in how they treat other people in this room .
Some may not like the fact that the technical group has been set up , but it 's been .
These members were chosen as I and every other Member of this House , and we have to accept this fact .
People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable .
We take note of your comments , McKenna .
Mr President , when in session on Monday , thanked the French Government , the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament to the fact that we could only get the sound of Finnish TV channel and taps will be cold water , but not hot , I do not mean that it should be , but that these things should be put .
I hope that the French Government , the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament can take action such small matters right so expensive building .
Well , SeppÃ¤nen , also took note of your comments .
Mr President , the sight of minutes , I 'm terrified to say that I have once again failed to sign the attendance list , even though I have participated in quite considerable number of roll - call votes .
I ask that my presence recorded in yesterday 's session .
It is not a problem .
Mr President , I do not have anything to complain minutes , but I want to say something about the European Parliament 's information services .
I do not know if I 'm the right time to say this .
It does not apply to the Protocol , but something else .
Just then , a colleague has just given me the news of the session the debate we had yesterday Ludford report , and I am disappointed that it does not mention the statement I made on behalf of our group .
I ask the Parliamentary Services to investigate why it has been omitted .
I can assure you that services will look into this very carefully , Mr Poettering .
Mr President , continues to yesterday 's minutes , I would like to express my extreme disappointment that even less than 200 members participated in the vote yesterday .
I found this minutes .
Well , Manders , we take into account all of this .
( The Minutes )
We refuse to make a choice between different ways in which capitalist groups and wealthy investors to manage the bank , because of what they are doing is against the interests of the working class and the majority of the population .
- ( FR ) The European Central Bank 's recommendation to get us to reflect and act cautiously for two reasons :
First of all , with regard to the method , it is clear that the procedure is the same : the Community institutions present the truncated reports that minimize the consequences of loss of sovereignty for the Member States , and then continue with successive small - scale tinkering .
In this way , the introduction of the euro , the Commission argued that the sovereignty of the Member States was in no way threatened by the ECB and the ESCB , which was established to hold and manage the official foreign reserves of the Member States .
However , they forget that on the other hand , the national central banks manage these funds on behalf of the ECB , which has sole control over monetary policy . On the other hand , even if Article 30 ( 1 ) of the Statute the ECB sets the maximum number of reserve assets of 50 billion euros , the amount considered sufficient to ensure the independence of the ECB , two years later , I learned independence is like to Article 30 ( 4 ) to make new property , because it will increase its independence and credibility ...
Second , what should be the content , " dressing up " of this new unreasonable requirement should not fool us . It is not only the case that more financial resources independent of the body so that it can be applied in an effective monetary policy , to the benefit of the Member States , but also , indirectly , creating additional resources technocratic structure so that it can finance ever more functional needs .
This kept secret skilfully blurred when the euro was meant to be " strong and stable " and foreign exchange reserves were originally intended to protect the transitional period ( if this proves necessary ) , it now appears that neither of these expectations are met , and Frankfurt stagnation is perfect !
Thus , another question arises effective use of financial resources .
Why the Member States to give up the resources of an institution , as a result of it shall be independent , can not be controlled ?
Finally , let us remember that the state is not defined only for self - determination , which has its autonomy of action .
In fact , experience shows that its prestige and credibility in the international arena will largely depend on the available resources : why we must take care , because of its gradual deprivation and eventually cause it to cease to exist !
The next item is the report ( A 5-0046 / 2000 ) Izquierdo Rojo , on behalf of Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on information measures relating to the common agricultural policy ( COM ( 1999 ) 536 - C 5-0249 / 1999 - 1999/0209 ( CNS ) ) .
Mr President , I Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation with regard to the information measures relating to the common agricultural policy .
This report is a precedent , as it is the first time that the Council consulted Parliament on these measures .
Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has examined this legislative resolution on the proposal very quickly and with great interest , and has approved it unanimously .
I would like to emphasize the following aspects of the amendments proposed by Parliament : First Amendment 2 , the rural information centers and are involved as agents for these measures .
Secondly , the amendment explicitly refers to the important role of young farmers of these measures .
Third , we will notify the Commission of the value of simplification and cutting through red tape as well as research programs presented and follow - up .
Fourth , singled out compatriot and women , farmers and other rural actors as the best possible for these measures .
They avoid the CAP passive , purely bureaucratic and technological fashion .
Therefore , we believe that Parliament 's amendments improve the text .
Fifth , with regard to the percentage of co - financing , the Parliament hopes that the Commission could increase this percentage by increasing the funding organizations or associations that do not have the funds .
Sixth , we already know that the proposal of the budget commitments of EUR 4.5 million annually EAGGF , an increase of 27 million in the current period 2000-2006 . However , the Parliament 's proposal shows that the European Commission should strengthen the allocation of resources so many organizations may participate in accordance with this Regulation .
Finally , Mr President , I wish to emphasize investing in amendment 10 , which proposed a new Article 5a , which defines the following criteria must be met programs or activities eligible : that these programs should promote sustainable , multifunctional agriculture ; by preserving or creating jobs ; they should promote the social and territorial cohesion ; they should be given the prominent role of women and young people ; they should protect the environment and safeguard the water , air and soil quality ; They should treat agricultural waste and control of energy consumption in rural areas , and transport .
The European Parliament wants the Commission to make these priorities , which are priority objectives for agriculture in 2000 , more understanding of these first awareness - raising activities .
I would like to thank all the members of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development support and cooperation they have given me all the meetings we have had .
I would also like the European Commission , one way or another , to take into account the criteria of the European Parliament .
Mr President , as a high priority as possible should be given to transparency and to keep EU citizens about the work of the EU .
By providing factual and objective information on co - operation in Europe has become very important in recent years , we have great challenges to the expansion of the EU in Central and Eastern Europe .
It is particularly important to explain what the common agricultural policy is all about and information about objectives , instruments and opportunities for improvement .
There are many target groups - farmers , above all , but also the people in general , as well as all directly or indirectly affected .
If this work is to succeed , it is important that the cooperation should be to create agricultural organizations , and also with consumers .
The Common Agricultural Policy was the first , and is also the most extensive of the Community 's integrated policy and it covers a very large portion of the EU budget .
Therefore , it is also important to make it clear that the support systems to ensure that consumers receive at prices that , as a result of the support , are lower than they would be without support .
This means that the EU 's agricultural support schemes for the benefit of all EU citizens .
The Common Agricultural Policy is always change and development .
The situations are very different in different countries , and it should therefore be agriculture organizations who are the main players , as these organizations focus specifically on farmers .
Mr President , the purpose of information on the common agricultural policy would be to draw up a strategy for communication , primarily intended for those who work in agriculture and rural areas .
We believe that the criticism of this draft Commission Regulation concerning the opening of the line to non - agricultural organizations , and also the reduction in budget appropriations EUR 4 500 000 .
This situation is further aggravated by the reserve funds that the Commission is creating for himself , which , when taken in conjunction with specific actions , in fact , leaves organizations with only 3 million , which is of course a very limited number .
That is why I am pleased with the rapporteur 's proposal that the Commission is responsible for the budget appropriations for a number of organizations that are eligible for participation in this Regulation .
However , one negative aspect of the Commission 's proposal concerning restrictive co - financing rate of 75 % , while the actions are carried out directly by the Commission financed at a rate of 100 % .
In addition , we know that the proposal means the rules makes access to the line I just mentioned even more difficult for organizations , especially those in a weaker economic position , in other words , the ones who need the most support .
It is therefore important for our amendment is intended to complement the concept presented in the report .
We hope that this amendment is adopted .
The amendment is designed to reduce the assets referred to the Commission by 1 million , and instead of adding specific actions , we believe that this is potentially a way to improve the Commission 's proposal for a regulation .
Finally , it is important to emphasize that the Commission 's simplification of administrative procedures , in order to examine the programs presented by organizations and their future follow - up .
Mr President , I welcome this measure .
From an administrative point of view the formal economy is a good thing .
But when we come to think of it as the amount of money is quite small - EUR 27 million for six years .
Take into account the size of the agricultural budget , and that it extends to all parts of the Union , it is a relatively small amount of money .
That is why I am pleased that the fact that most of it is used at a rate of 50 % instead of 75 % .
The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism .
One of the things that are not widely understood how important this policy is social point of view : it is that all the depressed regions of the EU , the CAP has maintained its population and has supported communities , social sense , that would not have otherwise survived .
This is especially true for peripheral countries such as Ireland , Greece , Spain and Portugal , where the entities that would be lost is to support and maintain , if not forever , then at least a change in economic environment , until the arrival of the new technology .
Long - term impact of the common agricultural policy in mind is greater than people are often imagined .
I can not find anything to complain about , like the Commission to interact with the agriculture industry over the years .
In my experience , the European Commission was open to representations and the exchange of information on agriculture as the largest agriculture in most Member States .
But there are new pressures arising from consumer concerns about new processes and systems to produce food .
These things have to be explained , not only to farmers , but consumers as well .
There are a lot of myths about what is safe and what is not safe .
We have an important task is to explain the workings of the entire production system of European consumers and third parties who buy food .
It is important that we use as much resources as possible to this .
The last thing I want to do is the fact that these pressures , we get a reaction from agriculture .
As we inevitably reduce the number of payments in the process of enlargement and at the same time maintain the pressure to protect the environment and consumers , then there will be friction between the producers and the European administration .
To devote as much resources as possible to a good relationship is a wise policy .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Maria Izquierdo Rojo , and the members of the Committee , in their report .
The proposed regulation is intended to provide the Commission with a tool , which allows it to present the European approach to agriculture and to give wider publicity to the common agricultural policy .
This implementation of agricultural policy easier .
Now , I would like to talk about the amendments proposed by Parliament . They are not normally seek to change the subject , but have to modify the proposals .
It is the opinion of the Commission that it is not necessary to mention the name of groups and organizations .
All agricultural organizations and rural part of the players on Article 2 .
This is the case , the proposed additions are unnecessary .
Amendments 5 , 8 and 10 relating to measures to be eligible for support .
Amendment 5 contains changes concerning the information services and forums for discussions with men and women in rural areas .
They are unnecessary because they are already included in the Commission proposal .
One of them , " to support them in their choices " is not consistent with the Commission 's proposal .
This regulation is not intended to give farmers a special service . Local bodies to better do it .
Are not enough resources for that either .
I would also like to make a comment , with regard to revisions of Article 3 of that information visits are not excluded .
The list of activities that are eligible for non - exhaustive tagged " in particular " .
The Commission is prepared to accept this .
Financing of long - term exchange programs can not be accepted , because such action is not part of an information policy .
Amendment 10 refers to Article 5 of Commission supports the objectives mentioned here , proof of which is seen in the fact that they are implicitly contained in Article 1 , which concerns the approach to European agriculture .
It is therefore not reasonable to repeat the contents of the model in more detail .
The Commission considers that it is not desirable to pay more than 75 % of the eligible support costs .
A smaller proportion will have more action there is , that it can be financed and higher multiple effect .
Amendments 9 and 12 concern the sharing and adoption of the budget .
As we know , the Parliament of the budgetary authority with the Council .
For this reason , the Commission considers amendment 9 is not necessary .
Amendment 12 , which proposes , among other things , funds the regulation , I would say that if the allocation is finalized , the administrative budget line to lose the necessary flexibility , which may be harmful to the view presented from the perspective of financial applications .
It can best be taken into account in the implementing regulation .
This extraordinary piece is unnecessary regulation , the Commission 's opinion .
Adjustable administrative details , evaluation and later assessment provided for in the Implementing Regulation .
In this regard , it should be noted that the effective monitoring of public funds is to ensure the process , regardless of how transparent and simple process .
Amendments 1 and 3 are the linguistic nuances .
The Commission does not consider significant , as the preamble of 4 and 7 of the Commission 's proposal are not as restrictive .
Thank you , Commissioner .
We will now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )

The next item is the report ( A 50045 / 2000 ) Izquierdo Rojo , on behalf of Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1577/96 introducing specific measures in respect of certain grain legumes [ COM ( 1999 ) 428 - C 50187 / 1999 - 1999/0182 ( CNS ) ]
Mr President , I Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1577/96 introducing specific measures for certain grain legumes .
The European Parliament has analyzed this proposal since October 1999 , and adopted the draft resolution by consensus on 23 February 2000 .
I would like to emphasize the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament .
First of all , Amendment 1 to the inclusion of the preamble of 2a .
Council only talking about the market , the European Parliament stressed the economic interest of the Community production of the grain legumes .
Allow the protein deficit in the European Union , the Parliament considers that this system should be improved by lowering the levels of support .
Secondly , the Parliament 's Amendment 2 proposes that of seed should also be included under the scheme .
The seeds for rice , chickpeas and lentils .
We suggest this because , as we all know , the seed production subject to additional technical requirements and quality control , so that if crop seeds do not support any kind of support , this could be a very negative impact on the quality of the production of seed .
Thirdly , Amendment 3 states , we believe that the Commission should , without delay , submit proposals for the period 2000-2003 .
Before I conclude , Mr President , I would like to point out that in 1993 - which has for many years - the Council announced its intention to gradually strengthen the current system and legumes .
This does not , however , yet been made .
The maximum guaranteed area is exceeded , a systematic and sanctioned again the farmers who are suffering from reductions in aid of up to 20 % .
Therefore , Mr President , what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament to really see an improvement of the system .
We are aware , however , of which the Commission is to us that this is a pretty serious budget , which we have been able to support the deduction .
Therefore , we present this proposal , which is really a maintenance proposal , and we say to the Commission is that the proposals have been drawn up without delay , at the latest for the period 2000-2003 to achieve improvement in this system without decreasing aid .
I want to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development cooperation and support , as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
Thanks also to the Commission its willingness to dialogue , and I hope that it is open to suggestions .
Mr President , the report , which proposed for adoption in plenary today means a small change to Regulation 1577/96 support for grain legume production in the field .
The change is so small reform , that it does not change the maximum guaranteed quantity , even if it split it into two , and the amount of aid per hectare .
The only new element is to replace the cable on the Management Committee for Cereals .
Therefore , my group will support the rapporteur 's report , and , above all , it is particularly support Amendment 2 , which proposes the inclusion of areas dedicated to the production of seed regions in the system of aid , since this will lead to high - quality plants .
Still , I want to make it clear that we have lost the ability to support a wide and very arid area of â€‹â€‹southern Europe , where there is no other alternative crops on its soil .
In addition , vetch demand for feed for livestock is growing all the time , as shown , at least in Spain , the fact that the area sown in the last three years has exceeded the proposed maximum guaranteed area of â€‹â€‹100 000 hectares per year on average .
On the other hand , we have been in the European Union have led to herbivores fed with animal feed , and if we do not encourage the feeding of livestock with plant proteins such as legumes , and lower the price , the farmers will continue to resort to animal meal due to the enormous pressure of competition .
Finally , I just want to lament , once again , that the Commission 's agricultural policy is more concerned to reduce spending - or , at best , rather than increasing it , as in this case - as maintaining a genuine European agricultural sector that is so essential for stability in a region .
Madam President , I am participating in this debate , in order to support my colleague , MarÃ­a Izquierdo , such as the Commission 's proposals , seem to me useful and interesting .
Grain legumes are a traditional crop in certain areas of southern Europe , such as Spain and more specifically , Castilla - La Mancha , I am from , which contains a third of the total area devoted to these crops in Spain .
We thus damaging the system of aid for this sector of agriculture and , more specifically , the production of chickpeas , lentils and vetch .
Chickpeas and lentils are two essential products in the Spanish culture and food in our diet , the Mediterranean diet , which is now so highly thought of researchers , which include dried vegetables in traditional recipes .
Dried vegetables Buying in Spain has grown up to 5 % per year .
Religious practices , for example , mean that we do not eat meat during Lent , and because the wiliness and common sense of our compatriots , the meat has been replaced by other dishes - delicious food , of course - as our lentil and spinach stew .
We are talking about applications that have been consolidated throughout history and now consumed throughout the year , including the non - believers and those who do not practice a religion , and who have left almost infinitely series of main courses based on the dried leguminous vegetables , which will certainly increase consumption .
Another area in which the need for this type of product is livestock farming .
In times like these , when the fraud is discovered fattened livestock and the use of banned substances , it is very important for the market to provide affordable , high - quality natural feed , such as that of some of this Regulation , vetches .
In addition , this is an area in which , fortunately , has not been the proliferation of bounty hunters who move to the agricultural order to receive support from the Union .
Here we are dealing with traditional crops cultivated by the people who dedicate themselves to these plants from generation to generation , and who have contributed to the formation of a large part of the countryside and the major food regions in Europe , which is still of interest to us and which we should preserve .
Therefore , I ask that the Parliament supports the Commission 's proposals and improvements which , by way of amendment , contained in a report by MarÃ­a Izquierdo .
Mr President , we support the expansion of the proposal , but at the same time I want to draw attention to the fact that the Agenda 2000 , which was decided last year in Berlin , of course , based upon our looking towards free trade and aims to reduce the existing aid schemes and reach several agreements under the auspices of the WTO pursuant to which market mechanisms , we can get better access to many markets around the world .
I would also like to draw attention to the fact that in recent years , conventional farming is pressured .
Farmers experience it in a slightly different way , because the costs are naturally rises and price freezes will automatically be set back .
I also remind you that the Commission has recently tightened up the conditions to intervene in the field of grain .
Wheat farmers , especially , seems very badly , which they are , because the 15 % decline in prices , but so also is the tightening of quality and in terms of protein .
This also means that , particularly in North EU , there will be further price falls in sight . On behalf of my team , I will , as I said , to continue to support the system , but I urge the Commission , prior to 2002-2003 , to make a concerted effort to examine potential changes in the way we use resources so that we can continue to safeguard the farmers , which until now has been supported by the aid scheme in question .
- ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , we have to support the production of grain legumes by improving the system without reducing the level of support , because of the current deficit , as well as grain legumes for human consumption and animal feed .
The fact is that the aid scheme was established in 1989 , has been amended several times , but no report has been presented the application of the current system .
In this situation , the Commission proposes a maximum guaranteed area of â€‹â€‹400 000 hectares , the Commission wants to reduce the average area of â€‹â€‹production over the last three years , about 100 000 hectares , which represents a significant reduction in support .
On the other hand , even if we do not disagree by dividing the guaranteed maximum two , we believe it is necessary to adjust the reference period , in order to calculate each of the maximum guaranteed without the last three years , in order to reduce the adverse effects of the Portuguese products designed for human consumption .
Finally , it is important to emphasize that it is of paramount importance to Portugal dry bean should be taken into account in this system , even without changes in the MGA .
Therefore , firmly believe that the Commission will take account of these changes to the new system , which it hopes to establish legumes .
Mr President , I would like once again to thank the rapporteur , Maria Izquierdo Rojo , the excellent and constructive report .
There are two Commission documents the basis for the issue of grain legumes .
The first report of a program of support in place legumes , and another proposal to improve system maintenance .
What vegetables are we actually talking about ?
I know that the Spanish members know the subject well , but it should be noted that grain legumes are meant three annual plants that have a high protein content and are harvested as dry seeds .
Lentils and chickpeas serve food for the people , when the seeds of vetches , that we are less common vegetables , used as animal feed .
Grain legumes are grown as field crops , especially in the southern part of the Union , as they thrive well in dry climates .
Grain legumes are not covered by the aid scheme , which was renewed by the Agenda 2000 program , although they can be used in crop rotation with other crops such as corn .
Grain legumes has its own system , which of fixed rate aid per hectare is 181 euros and the maximum guaranteed area of â€‹â€‹400 000 hectares .
The system was set up in 1989 , when the growing area of â€‹â€‹grain legumes was reduced at the expense of corn , which was already in surplus .
Special scheme aimed to preserve traditional legume grain zones to aid per hectare facility .
What are the conclusions of the Commission 's report ?
To examine how the system has been applied reveals that the MGA is 400 000 hectares has been systematically exceeded .
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this .
Firstly , the objective has been successfully achieved , and secondly , the growing areas is to stabilize the better .
Although the system is applied satisfactorily as a whole , MGA management is problematic , because they correspond to the exceedances are not treated differently from other producers .
So how can the system be improved ?
We should try to find solutions for improvements within the framework of the current system and the envelope it .
We are in a situation where the Agenda 2000 reform has been accepted and international trade negotiations are yet to come .
I would like to point out that the rapporteur 's proposed amendment , which the current system of support vetch farmers could be linked to another market arrangement , ie , that of seed , is not desirable for improvement . This is a reference to Amendment 2 .
It is unacceptable for two reasons : first , the systems are mutually exclusive , as the second seed , in principle , the system must be corrected for animal feed and in the second they are sowing the seeds .
The second reason is that it could lead to additional expenditure .
The Commission 's report recommended that MGA would be divided into two parts based on previous land division in proportion 40/60 . It is divided as follows : 1 600 000 hectares could be used for the production of lentils and chickpeas , and 240 000 hectares could be used for the production of vetches .
In addition , it is proposed that the Management Committee of dry feed is replaced by the Management Committee for Cereals .
Finally , I would like to say that the Commission accepts the rapporteur 's amendments , which will strengthen its position , it is proposed that the Commission will present a new report , as in Amendment 3 , and aims to improve the system , as Amendment 1 .
Members of the European Parliament in the light of the comments , the proposal does not seem difficult to accept such a way that it can be applied from the marketing year 2000 - 2001 onwards .
Thank you , Commissioner .
We will now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Complementarity
Next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission :
B 5-0207 / 2000 , Evans and others on behalf of the Greens / European Free Alliance complementarity
B 5-0209 / 2000 , Davies and Attwooll on behalf of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , the additionality of the structural funds .
Mr President , Commissioner , the purpose of the Structural Funds to target the poorest and most run - down areas of the European Union , they are most in need of development , the extra money will help them begin to rebuild the economy , create jobs and revitalize poor communities .
Complementarity is intended to ensure that this happens , and to prevent governments from EU funding to replace their own aid as it would be an object .
But in many regions and countries , this happens at the moment and I can illustrate the problem by using the example of Wales .
The award of the Objective 1 areas in West Wales and the Valleys last year was recognition of poverty , two - thirds of the country .
EUR 1.2 billion in EU funds are spent effectively be able to provide you with the extra help that is intended .
The National Assembly budget , which comes from the Ministry of Finance remains the same , so that the first fifteen months , at least , the new period , there are no additional resources at all .
This money comes from the budgets of the National Assembly , such as health and education .
This government spending is reduced .
The Structural Funds , areas of greatest need are identified and selected regional criteria .
Even when the Commission will examine the complementarity it is addressed on the national level .
This is a clear contradiction .
The rules as they are to make this possible .
Member States are not legally show the complementarity of regional or program level .
I agree with the statement by Commissioner Barnier , in a written reply , he said that the spirit rather than the letter of the law is an important consideration .
We need a revision of the system , a key part of that is looking for the complementarity of the Member States at the program level as well as at national level .
These mechanisms must be to ensure that Member States comply with the principle and spirit , so that resources are allocated and used efficiently .
So we ask this question , Commissioner , for confirmation that this will be done , and look forward to vote on this debate in April .
Mr President , the principle of complementarity exists , in order to ensure that the transfer of the Structural Funds , Member States , and not replacing national funding structural development measures .
In this way the European Union 's structural policy has a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities .
Ex - ante evaluation of additionality is currently being carried out in application of Article 11 of Regulation 1260/99 . This is an integral part of the negotiation process of the Structural Funds programs in the Member States .
This exercise is an indication of the Member States the principle of complementarity intention to carry out the programming period in front of us .
If necessary , the Commission may request clarification from the Member States eligible for the details of the forecasts for the period 2000-2006 .
As a new measure , the Commission has drawn up a detailed implementing provisions have been included in the programming documents , covering both the ex - ante evaluation of the situation and also the mid - term and final verification of additionality .
The second part of the question is the possibility of complementarity issues at the regional level .
I would like to develop a number of previous answers .
First of all , even if additionality is implemented at the level of all the eligible costs of the Member States and at the regional level , it should be remembered that the overall which should be addressed by definition , the sum of the eligible expenditure at the lower level .
In practice , the eligible costs of the national decline in some areas should be balanced with an increase in other areas , in order to comply with the complementarity in general .
In this regard , the Commission may give assurances that where there is evidence of reduced national expenditure in a particular area or areas , it will be particularly attentive with regard to the credibility of the integers .
Another explanation relates to the scope of additionality and the reference to the fact that the implementation at the national level , it may be in conflict with the regional efforts of the Structural Funds .
It should be remembered that the development - related expenditure in the Member State which is not taken into account in the assessment of additionality is usually a mix of distributed and managed at national level and those managed at the regional level .
While there might be some categories of expenditure for which stability can be expected at the regional level between programming periods , it is impossible to propose that the level of consumption , for example , major infrastructure should be maintained at the same level in each region regardless of current needs .
Therefore , the Commission considers that the strict application of additionality at the regional level would lead to excessive rigidity in the management of Member States ' own development costs .
Finally , the budgetary provisions of the Member States between the central government and the regions , the Commission can only repeat that these are matters exclusively for national consideration and are not related to additionality as defined in the regulations .
Mr President , may I begin by thanking my colleague from Wales - though the other party , Jillian Evans , raise the issue .
I do not think that is the important thing in Wales at the moment as the application of Objective 1 funds , and it is important to look at the background to the issues that we are currently .
There are two major news in the UK today .
One is the shock news of BMW 's decision to break up the Rover Land Rover Group and the threat of massive layoffs across the United Kingdom , and other news this morning is the Conservative Party 's stunning victory in Ayr by - election driving defense of the Workers ' Party miserable third place with a swing of almost 10 % .
I think they support the very things that we are considering the context of the structural funds in Objective 1 and 2 in the parts of the European Union , which is a major economic problems .
As we have already heard Jillian Evans , the majority of Wales constituencies I represent , has been granted Objective 1 status , but unfortunately , ever since the announcement was made of the Commission , problems in Wales , in fact , even worse .
As a direct result of what I would describe as UK government policy , our agricultural economy has all but collapsed .
I do not apologize for saying that a large overvaluation of the pound , which gives the British Labour Chancellor of the election war chest of unprecedented proportions has a disability that the Welsh and the English manufacturer is trying to export to the European market .
It is little wonder that BMW Rover blame the decision directly to the UK government economic policy , but I 'm afraid that is little comfort to the thousands of workers Rover , which are strained to boost the company only to find that their efforts are being undermined in Downing Street .
I turn then hand the Central Labour Board 's duties are defined by the European Structural Funds package .
Acceptable behavior of the British government during this has already been brought in time for the end of the political career of the first secretary of the Welsh .
Unfortunately , the Structural Funds spending issues have been characterized by delayed disputes related to self - financing in relation to the issue of complementarity .
In order to prevent it is to be raised in this debate , I would like to make it clear : this is not a new thing , and I agree that it is something that should be carefully examined by the Commission itself .
I have the honor to appoint a rapporteur Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the Structural Funds 2000-2006 and the guidelines of the Committee agreed that , based on the recommendations of the Committee on Regional Policy , the Commission should pay attention to the issue of additionality .
We reiterated the importance of ensuring that the Structural Funds are not only just , as if to replace public expenditure funds reserved for those regions that are lagging behind .
I am a little sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in preparing the report , but there it is .
There are several questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen , Commissioner Barnier back .
I understand that he is a Commissioner at the moment , but he may not be able to answer these questions for yourself .
However , these are things that I do not seek to put in context , certainly the area that I represent , and I venture to say they are the points that also Jillian Evans on behalf of his party .
What progress has been made in relation to the approval of programming documents at the Commission ?
Will he take a step in transparency and publish the appropriate time , the correspondence that has taken place and the Commission of the National Assembly ?
We were assured , I have to say rather complacent Economic Secretary , who has now become the first Secretary , that all things proceeded in good order .
Yet we hear the comments that have been made from time to time the Commission that there is a real problem , and we find it difficult to do our job in Parliament without that degree of transparency .
So , will the Commission undertake to make such information available to all Members of the European Parliament ?
Will they undertake to keep us informed on these matters ?
Will they undertake to challenge the governments of Member States in relation to the maps have been prepared in relation to the objective 2 which also has been very clear evidence jerrymandering also .
The question of complementarity is important , but I must say , it 's not the only one that gives a lot of concern to many members of the European Parliament .
Mr President , I just want to touch up a couple of Mr Evans .
First of all , I admit that it is difficult Midlands Rover Group .
I would not want to make a political benefit from it .
Secondly , he also mentioned their election .
But , unlike him , I have been in Ayr for the last three weeks , on the doorstep .
I turn to the question at hand .
It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole issue of the Structural Funds .
What are they actually trying to achieve ?
Basically , what I took from his speech that he wants to redefine the Structural Funds ' regulations .
I would remind this House that it was not so long ago that this Parliament approved , the approval procedure , rules and regulations governing the Structural Funds , including Article 11 , which complementarity .
We should not be changed .
The role of Parliament is to ensure that rules are followed .
That 's what we should focus on .
I know that Mr Evans with one of his colleagues , Dafydd Wigley , and a member of the Scottish National Party , Mr Wilson , went to see Mr Barnier .
I 'd like to read aloud a statement after a meeting with Commissioner Barnier :
" I know that there have been a lot of debate in Scotland and Wales in recent times the European Union , regional funding .
But I have the impression that this is sometimes confused two separate issues - additionality and co - financing .
I 'm not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion nationalist .
Complementarity , whether EU funding for additional effect , compared to what would otherwise have occurred , can be used as a selection criterion for the local program planners before they decide to accept the support for individual projects .
However , the Commission is obliged to make a general assessment of the rules of complementarity across the UK , with the specific objective is to ensure that the financial support to , and not a substitute for national funding .
We have always been happy with the past that national requirements are met . "
Mr President , it is clear what the Commissioner said that the Commission has a conscientious assessment of additionality of structural funding at Member State level , and it was also good to hear his assurances about the various different levels of evaluation occur .
As the Commission is aware , however , several Member States within the European Union have given up their regional government .
Such regional government is usually financed in whole or in part from State funds .
It seems to me that the current rules , the central government may be granted by the EU structural funding calculations for determining regional government budgets .
There seems to be no mechanism in spite of what the Commissioner said , for ensuring either of two things : first , that the principle of additionality of this calculation , and second , that the amount of EU funding , which eventually ends up in individual regions corresponds to the number of regions at the planning stage .
At least , this creates a lack of transparency .
It may also mean that the principle of complementarity is not properly implemented on a region - by - region basis .
I have to admit , like Evans , that this does not actually conflict with the letter of the European Union legislation in this area .
But , unlike him , it seems to me to be quite clearly contrary to the spirit of additionality rules and undermine the very purpose for which the financing structure was set up in the first place .
Even though I 'm from Scotland , I know these things are of concern not only for my Liberal Democrat colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom but also in the ELDR members representing all regions of the European Union .
Mr President , first of all I want to congratulate my Welsh colleague for his excellent speech , and I am also glad that the treaty in every aspect of the political spectrum .
Some of us are new Members of Parliament are already beginning to tire of good intentions , excellent programs , and the fact that talking about the spirit of the Community rules .
Instead , in the spirit , we are going to end up with ghosts and sleepless nights , because in reality the commitments are not met .
It is therefore appropriate that the European institutions themselves start by making good compliance with the commitments are complementary .
The Court has already made an assessment on the implementation of the principle of complementarity in June 1999 , which shows that it is a complete disaster and error .
Second , we must take into account - and this is a political declaration - the real Europe , Europe for Citizens , European nations and peoples within states , because until these are taken into account , we will come back to the same old problem .
Scotland , Wales , the Basque Country , Catalonia , Galicia , even in a region as large as Andalusia , can not depend on the decisions of the central government , however , much of the state .
Mr President , I wish to repeat what Mr Miller , who spoke in the past - and that is , unfortunately , no longer in the Chamber - when he criticized the authors of this question by saying that the most important task is to ensure that the rules are complied with .
The first rules to be followed are the contract , in this case , Article 158 , which sets out the economic and social cohesion of the highest level .
Our job is to make sure that the following is the case , the Commission 's regulations and policies to promote and serve to achieve these objectives .
Our mission is to be alert enough here to criticize , and to raise the issue whenever we see that this has not been done .
We support good timing and justification of the questions the authors of the oral question , and we agree , that has already been done here .
We urge the Commission to the pressure to ensure that these tools are used effectively in areas with the greatest needs , instead of , as it seems to us , letting the objective of economic and social cohesion go cold .
This topic is obviously sensitive , and its development has been much discussion in recent years , and many of the provisions are reviewed on a regular basis , but we can not accept the fact that a review of these rules and the development of bureaucracy always hit the most needy .
We can not , for example , accept the fact that the problems have been attracted to allocate grants to certain areas of the various programs , because if these areas are entitled to various aid just because their needs are the greatest , and most of all , which prevents the operation of these funds slows down their development and threatens the goal of economic and social cohesion .
Similarly , we do not accept that the Commission should in no way agree with the degree of the slow than some national governments , who are not ready to support the areas where the needs .
We therefore call on the Commission to ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , I have been following this whole business of the Structural Funds and additional support for many years , and there are many things that we can learn from the past .
The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small , and its effect is more of a political than economic - though that is important too .
I have often said that it is important that we in the European Union should not only adopt regulations to tell people what they can or can not do , but what we should show the citizens of Europe and the EU regions have tangible benefits .
Even in rich regions appreciate the fact that the European Union is trying to eliminate the gap between rich and poor .
Another thing is the macroeconomic sense , we can say that if a certain amount of Structural Funds allocated to Portugal or Greece or Ireland , as it has been in the past , then the money goes to the states case , and it is the first effect that it has .
The money is actually transferred , and regardless of whether the letter of the law is not detected or not , countries will be better .
Another thing I would like to make is that we can learn from the past .
First of all , we have now tidied up the settings to some extent , but originally they were written to please every sector and every political interest , so that it became impossible , with the staff that the European Commission had at its disposal , the police , spending money , and it is still the case to a great extent .
We are now into the third or fourth of the program .
What we need to do is to learn from past mistakes and try to apply the lessons to the future .
If you want to be an effective way of this money is used for , what you need to do is to look at what the country has used in the past , and ask them to submit their plans to the European Commission .
The European Commission identifies shortcomings in the plan and says : This is the way we would like our money is used in addition to what you 've already booked for all the work you plan to do .
My experience in Ireland , I have never heard of the European Commission to Ireland for its failure in the area .
But you should remember that in 1982 and 1992 , the Structural Funds for Ireland at its peak ; they are getting less now , and there was a generous amount of money .
But , 1982-1992 , the public capital program actually reduce the Structural Funds .
So what is the Structural Funds to go ?
Structural Funds actually went into the public sector pay and social welfare , and it is very questionable whether they did good or bad turn to the Irish economy in those years , because they contributed to inflation and increased wage demands .
So there is to learn : set against the staff of the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem - three or four people - Ireland was 30 000 civil servants , and the Irish Civil Service won every time !
Mr President , I am going to talk about a subject that none of the speaker previously discussed .
I refer to the report of the Court 's principle of complementarity .
This is a report , which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 9 March .
This report includes a very interesting section - section 62 - talk about privatization .
In recent years , a number of European Union governments have enthusiastically embarked on a policy of privatization of property , which before belonged to the community very few hands .
For example , in Spain in the last four years , public companies have been privatized tune 4000000000 , where B Barcelona or Brussels . These public companies are transferred to private hands .
Mr Liikanen is an expert and he knows that privatization is a form of public investment and , specifically , that it may be a way to cancel regional investments .
For example , if the airline provides local services have been privatized , regional disinvestment could take place , and we would therefore infringe the principle of complementarity .
Taking into account the importance of the headings , telecommunications , energy , etc. , this simple procedure can alter the outcome .
And we also have the answer to the Commission , which must be recent , and which the Commissioner Liikanen , as member of the College to remember for sure .
The Commission is responsible for this is a system , which we call Olendorf method , the method of language learning , which consists of the teacher asks the student , " Do you have my uncle 's socks ? " and students respond with " No , but I have my grandmother 's glasses " .
And the answer given to us by the Commission in Section 62 is very short .
It says : " While the private sector sometimes invests in sectors that are traditionally considered public , it would be exceedingly difficult to increase the private investment , as this would mean the collection and examination of the accounts of a number of private companies which would not be required to provide similar information to the national authorities or the Commission " .
That is , the Commission is responding to Olendorf method .
We have here , Commissioner Liikanen , who knows the topic well , and maybe he could give us a more concrete answer , because I believe that this will affect significantly the core of complementarity .
Another issue is that the Berlin financial projections substantially reducing the structural funds .
This year we have 29 430 million . In 2006 , there is a nominal figure was 26 600 million , ie , a discount of 14 % over seven years .
Taking into account inflation , I can calculate that a reduction of 20 % .
So , from now until 2006 , the Structural Funds to lose more than 20 % compared to the current year , which means that it will be very difficult to meet the needs of today and , as we have heard , there are still many problems in many areas of the Community .
There is one more problem that should not hide the members of the Commission or the Parliament : we are talking about the future enlargement of the European Union thirteen new countries , most of which are much lower than the average income of the poorest regions of the Community and the plans did not comply with the cohesion policy in respect of such candidate Member States .
I know that the Commission is not able to give me an answer to this question , but I draw the House and the problem that this causes , particularly the Community 's cohesion .
Mr President , although I endorse everything that Medina said , I want to say that even though we are a small group with very little time to talk , I do not see the report of the Court that he mentioned that just 9 March this year .
Mr President , Commissioner , as has been said here , the EU funds can not replace Member States ' public spending and structural support , which runs parallel with it .
This principle of additionality is important to reduce regional disparities , which is the aim of the EU regional and structural policy .
The Commission shall require the Member States to act in such a way that the principle of complementarity has been implemented both nationally and regionally .
I suspect that this principle seriously violated in the Member States .
Regional failure of additionality make the situation worse internal regional disparities within Member States , which is contrary to the objectives of the Union 's regional policy .
President , it is a pity that Commissioner Barnier can not be here this morning , because this is a matter for her , which causes great concern not only to Scotland and Wales , but the rest of the Union .
It is a real concern , because it is made to appear as though the system , which is intended to provide specific instructions on actually which is just a sleight of hand by the Commission and the national governments that additional funding should be coming in , but afterwards we are told , it does not matter whether extra money went to any of the a particular area , as long as it went all over the country .
We are also told , however , that all is well , because of the complementarity principle of the Regulation are currently being made through properly .
Yet the Court of Auditors , the very report that we have spoken , says the following things : difficulties arising from the weak development of the principle of and the methods and the joint failure to find appropriate and effective procedures for verifying it .
And then two paragraphs later , the identification of structural relief activities eligible regions is unreliable , and this leads to the inclusion of a number of estimates and assumptions that are difficult to verify .
" Difficult " is , indeed , Sir .
No wonder that this will cause unrest throughout the Community , and let us ask the Commission to give it your full attention .
I think we need to look at this problem in detail , and we also need better coordination between DGs in this case .
Complementarity is a concept , and it is up to you to make sure that it works effectively in the Member States .
We also realize , of course , the problems you are facing in the programs overlap , creating problems of continuity for you .
Evaluation is another issue that must be resolved with the Member States , as they are to blame .
No additional money is included in the budget , we in Wales .
This is a clear failure to comply .
The European Parliament and the European Union recognize that the nation of Wales is poor and yet the government of the Kingdom , not only in the Labour Government did not comply with the additionality .
It is not enough for my colleague Jonathan Evans gives the impression that his party is not to blame .
Eighteen long years , the concept of complementarity was not respected during his government .
I think that some of the lost forces , Mr President .
I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday .
It is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion , and we ask the Commission to comply with it and to help the poorest regions in the European Union .
Mr President , I was not going to talk about today , because I represent the South East of England , which is one of the most prosperous areas of the UK and Europe .
We pay taxes to grants to other areas .
We do not have Objective 1 funding .
What Objective 2 funding , which we have reduced the current government and the Conver - financial , to be very helpful is now being phased out .
So why do I speak ?
Since even the South East of England is a poor regions .
In particular , I want to talk about the Isle of Wight , a beautiful island 130 000 good people , but 68 % of GDP per capita than the European average - a very poor region .
It does not get funding from Europe because the NUTS II , it is classified Hampshire .
Still , it has a population of 130 000 , which is more than the Ã…land Islands , which is part of the NUTS II and get grants from the European Union .
The island has brought the case against the British Government that it seems to treat it unfairly , the High Court in London .
As far as Europe is concerned , advised them to take the matter to the Ombudsman , because we believed that Eurostat , who refused to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , treating the island unfairly .
Let me read out his decision : " In the present case , the Commission has not submitted to the Ombudsman factors which show that Eurostat , the decision not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region , taking into account all relevant factors , such as Article 158 of the Treaty and Viola report of the European Parliament " .
He recommended that the Commission and Eurostat should re - examine this problem .
I would ask the Commission to examine openly this recommendation , which has become the Ombudsman so that I can return to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this thing is going to be re - examined , that they can expect the fair treatment of specific problems and concerns of the island .
Then we can get this law of complementarity and take up our fight for the British government to ensure that we will have support from Europe and the British government to deal with in a fair island , which has so far been fairly treated with either the British government or the European Union .
- Mr President , Tony Blair and Donald Dewar has not slept well last night !
Their worst nightmares have proven to be true .
The Labour Party in Scotland kernels are for them has become the message .
Scottish Labour voter - as long taken for granted - has spoken .
This will only get worse in working life when the truth of the incompetent and cynical administration of the European Union 's Structural Funds should be better known and better understood .
Given that the Labour Government in submitting its proposed maps for nine months late in December and in March last year , it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects .
Scottish local authorities are left not knowing whether the projects in which they have taken on the responsibility , indeed the Structural Funds .
Commissioner : three questions :
When are you going to be able to provide security for the Scottish regions and in desperate need projects that seek EU support ?
Are you satisfied with the capability of the Scottish Government to provide additional financing and assure you that it is actually an additional ?
I have listened carefully to this interesting discussion , and I care about all the issues raised here by my colleague Mr Barnier , and he will respond .
I 'm sure she will send you the answer , at least as to the questions relating to the Structural Funds and additionality .
Mr President , Commissioner Liikanen could not help but respond to the debate formally and say that he had heard what had been said , and would pass it on .
It is not very satisfactory in terms of number of Members of Parliament , who made important points .
I ask that Mr Barnier gives a written summary of his answers to these questions .
I am sure that Commissioner Barnier is willing to follow up on this interesting discussion .
The vote will be on 11 April .
Adjournment of the session
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish you a good weekend and I declare the session of the European Parliament was adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 10:50 )
Statement by the President
Eleven people were killed in an avalanche and that is not the final death toll . It can be even worse .
The next few hours will tell . I would just like to tell you that in these difficult times of my thoughts , indeed , our thoughts go out to the victims of this disaster and their families .
I would like to fix it , because the meaning is distorted .
It says : " So I can tell the House that , as well as Felix Habsburg - Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg - Lothringen is a valid passport without any kind of restriction . "
Now comes the error : " Neither a signatory to the notifications required by the abandonment of the constitutional office , because they " are the distance between the " self - Habsburg " is what is recorded verbatim .
In addition , there has clearly been a return to the suppression of journalistic activity , which is documented in the report other sources .
We believe that these actions by the Turkish Parliament against members of the topics are very serious concern .
I would like the Turkish government asked to determine whether the lists also exist in European countries than in Italy .
Thank you , Mr Morgantini .
We have , of course , investigate the matter thoroughly .
Mr President , I rise to speak about what has just been said Morgantini .
In my capacity as President of Socialist delegation which visited Turkey , on Monday night , after talking to the Prime Minister Ecevit , to bring the situation Birdal , and Mrs. Zana , and express our concern - and I would like to point out that we were able to get the first report , which deals with the process of the Turkish Government to align the Turkish Constitution and the laws of the Copenhagen criteria - we had a meeting at the headquarters of the Commission in Ankara with representatives of non - governmental organizations , also a member of Birdal , who participated in a very active role in the meeting .
Yesterday , Tuesday morning , Birdal was sent to prison to serve the sentence , that the Turkish courts have imposed on him .
Turkey , the EU expressed its vigorous condemnation of the fact that a person who has fought for human rights for many years , such as Birdal - who has not paid his life in this battle , but he is , unfortunately , paid for his health - had gone to prison .
We have also expressed our opinion - which I think is not only that of the Socialist Group , but also the whole of Parliament - that , in order to set the Turkish path that can lead to a good relationship supports full accession , it is clearly necessary - such as the Turkish government now says - to change the constitution and the law , and also to implement the law pardon , so that people like Ms. Zana , who is in prison , or Birdal , who has just gone to jail , do not have to pay for crimes statement , which , fortunately , is not in any of our countries .
Mr President , you will recall perfectly that the last plenary session that we had here in Brussels , all the political groups without exception , condemned the murder of the Basque Socialist Member of Parliament , Fernando Buesa , in the hands of ETA .
Since then , Mr President , dozens of Spanish and Basque citizens have been victims of attacks , blackmail and threats of a type which can be described as fascist .
In fact , almost every day we see the events that will take us back to the darkest days of the history of Europe .
Spanish journalist Carlos Herrera is a symbol of all those victims , Mr President , and I would like to ask you , on behalf of the European Parliament , to convey to him our sense of belonging , as this indicates an indisputable solidarity to defend the freedom of speech that we Democrats are obliged to do .
Kiitos Galeotea .
We can assure the supplier in question this institution complete solidarity and resistance really a shameful act of terrorism .
Mr President , I wish to inform Parliament about the incident which occurred at the joint meeting of the European Parliament for Relations with Canada and its Canadian counterpart , who was here visiting last week .
Sturdy , chairman of our delegation was unable to attend at that time , Mr President , but he has written to you this morning to confirm what I 'm going to say .
Something quite astonishing for this type of meeting was held .
President of the Canadian delegation suddenly launched into the most obnoxious personal attacks on myself , because no reason , to the point that the other members of his delegation spoke up to break with his words .
Everything was just dumbfounded that attitude .
This is unfortunate extreme , because otherwise this was a good visit , and because we want to maintain the best relations with Canada , after so many difficult years , mainly due to conflicts over fishing .
It is necessary to restore good relations and , therefore , sorry this event the most .
Mr President , I want you to ask the Canadian government for some explanation of the importance of these declarations .
Tietenkin Berthun .
This is certainly a very unfortunate incident .
In fact , I remember , as I have said , that the members of the Canadian delegation expressed their apologies for this incident and offered apologies .
Mr President , 13 April will see the beginning of the experiment , Iran , thirteen Iranian citizens who are of the Jewish religion .
Since they accused of spying for the United States and Israel - who have refused any contact with them - is quite likely that the thirteen citizens could face the death penalty .
Mr President , I know that you have already intervened at the request of certain Members of Parliament , to require that the delegation of the European Parliament to be present at the trial , but if I am not mistaken , the Iranian government has so far not been granted nor refused the request .
I ask you to intervene again , and I also urge the Commission to intervene in order to ensure that human rights are fully respected during this trial , so that thirteen people have been sentenced to death for unknown reasons , as this Parliament has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the death penalty .
I would like to thank you in advance for your efforts and the efforts of Parliament and the European Commission to protect the freedom and respect for the rights of the defense in legal proceedings , these thirteen Iranian Jews .
Mr Tajani , you are absolutely right .
I did approach the Iranian government , but received no response .
Tomorrow 's agenda is the subject of human cloning .
It is important that Members of Parliament , as they prepare for the debate to be aware of the fact that the scientists who work behind the research leading to the patent are given categorical assurance that their project has nothing to do with cloning , and it is not at any point is directed to the direction .
This does not affect any of the key issues in the debate on the conduct Patent Office , but because it is related to the reputation of individuals I consider it fair and reasonable that this should be taken into account Members of Parliament .
I should also mention your interest in because I am a professor at the University of unpaid leave , provided that the plant , which is also included .
Ladies and gentlemen , I want to get on with the agenda .
I do not think that all these charges are genuine points of order .
We still have two of them , though .
Mr President , I will be very brief .
We share Galeote 's disapproval displays of political violence in the Basque Country .
Having said this , I think it would be more accurate analysis and fairer representation of the facts , if the violence attributed to its real leaders .
The murderers of the Basque Country are inspired by the doctrine of Benito Mussolini , but Marxism .
These are the extreme left - wing ideas represented in Parliament .
If we do not , then , that they benefit ...
Mr President , I would like to just follow what Morgantini said lists in Turkey .
It seems that there is also a list of the Greek subjects , and I can see that Turkey 's Foreign Minister has said that any country can make such lists .
Of course , I imagine , he is a land that does not belong to the European Union ....
( The President cut off the speaker )
Katiforis we are going to look into it , thank you .
Welcome to
Ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the House , I would like to welcome visitors to the gallery the Scottish Parliament 's European Committee , headed by Hugh Henry , was convened .
The Scottish Parliament is one of the newest institutions of the European Union , which , as you know , parliamentary elections were held in May 1999 , and the Parliament , was opened in July of the same year .
In fact , it was our former colleague Ewing , which I welcome , in particular , who opened the first session of the Scottish Parliament .
( Applause )
We hear the statements of the Commission and President of the Council tomorrow interception of telecommunications .
It is a sensitive subject . It is one in which the powers of the Union is strictly limited and the main political groups have been reluctant to take a stand before heard of the Council and the Commission .
So we ask that the vote be postponed to the April part - session , and that the period for calculating the movements pursuant to Rule 37 of our Rules to re - open , so that it can eventually leave the draft resolution .
Mr President , I would like to speak in support of this movement .
I must say I find it extremely reasonable , because the debate is due to take place shortly , and we look forward to the details , which will enable us to provide more information about the opinion on this very important issue .
I know in any case that it is usually sensible , Madam President , not to give an opinion , until one is in possession of all the facts , and , in particular , expect the speaker has come to the end of speaking time before deciding on the motion .
Is there any objection to Watson 's request , on behalf of his committee to postpone the vote on the resolution on the Echelon system until April session ?
( Parliament approved )
General product safety - BSE tests
Mr President , I had two things within the competence of the Commission discussed this morning , and I have the honor and pleasure to report to Parliament on both issues .
First as you mentioned , by proposals to amend the Directive on general product safety .
I am very happy to introduce to you a draft revision of the Directive on general product safety , approved by the Commission today .
The idea is actually quite simple .
Only safe food or industrial products are to be placed on the market , and this means European products as well as imported products .
The two main objectives of the General Product Safety Directive are , first , to ensure a high and consistent level of protection of consumer health and safety throughout Europe and , secondly , to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market .
We are committed to an extensive review of the exercise the implementation of the current Directive .
The main findings of the report can be recycled in parallel with the draft revision of the Directive .
Although the general approach of the Directive is sound , experience has shown certain weaknesses , which we are now trying to correct .
First I want to clarify the scope of the Directive .
This Directive is intended to provide consistent assurances of safety products to consumers .
It is also intended to fill any gaps in sectoral legislation , such as market surveillance and emergency situations , which are rarely provided six pieces of legislation .
It does not , however , apply to cases where a particular sector legislation covers the same aspects will be considered .
We want to ensure that the Directive gives the best coverage possible products used by consumers .
Two examples of that would be hair - dryers or hair salon equipment in the gym center .
This means , therefore , additional obligations on producers and distributors to provide information .
This is probably the most important factor in this was amended a number of provisions .
The current situation is in fact far from ideal .
It is quite inconceivable that the authorities of a Member State , for example , announced in the United States of a given product , which was dangerous , because the rules that prevail in the European Union do not offer this .
This notice is mandatory in the United States but not yet in the European Union .
This provision is intended to remedy this situation .
I would also like to strengthen market surveillance in Member States .
Member States are now required to confirm the tasks of the supervisory authorities .
They are needed to establish sanctions ; the need to develop links with other Member States , in particular through a network of supervisory authorities in the Member States .
This is very important for the industry point of view , in order to ensure that a level playing field is maintained between competitors , particularly in relation to imported goods .
We also want to improve the rapid alert system , which is operated by the Commission to monitor information on dangerous products and measures .
The practical operation of the system is improved .
We are now also envisage the possibility of opening the system to third countries , in particular in the candidate countries .
We will also introduce provisions to simplify the procedures for urgent measures at Community level , so that we can take swift action to advise the Regulatory Committee .
Consumers often lack confidence because they do not know what will happen .
We believe that in line with the general policy of the Commission , the public has a right to know what the real dangers they are exposed to and measures .
Limitations of this is , of course , secrecy , as defined in Article 287 of the Treaty , but it is , of course , unless there is a compelling public health considerations .
I believe that this proposal can effectively contribute to our common goal of ensuring a high level of consumer health and safety , and look forward to more detailed discussions with Members of Parliament in the future on the matter .
May I on behalf of my team , to assure the Commissioner that these proposals are welcome and ask him a few questions of them : First of all , he could tell us more about the consultation on the program of the candidate countries ?
It is important that those countries which want to join the European Union should be fully aware of the changing nature of the acquis communautaire and regulations that they must comply with .
Will there be regular dialogue , in which they are involved ?
Second , I could ask the process by which hazardous products , or products that are considered to be dangerous , withdrawal from the market .
In this case , it is the thing that it is possible to speed up the procedure , the rapid process of taking something out of the market when it is perceived as dangerous ?
Flammable furniture would be the case I have in mind .
Is there going to be extending the area of â€‹â€‹control , which takes into account the products of this sort ?
Thank you , Whitehead those words of support , which I am very satisfied .
Let me say in relation to the question of the candidate countries is an ongoing discussion in relation to this matter .
My service , and GÃ¼nter Verheugen , the service , which , of course , is the lead service for enlargement of the discussion on this , not only in matters relating to public health , but also consumer protection .
Questions such as this provision to our attention .
In relation to the second part of your question , the speedy removal of hazardous substances , I want to assure you that under the rapid alert system RAPEX system is going to be the quick removal , which has been found to be dangerous to the market .
Thirdly , I am aware of the concerns about the burning furniture and other items , and these are kept under review .
Commissioner , you have just made a very important point that consumers should be able to rely on .
They should be able to rely on in all sectors and the whole range of instruments is apparently carried out for this purpose , in particular , the White Paper consumption and food security .
Today , in order to more meaningful to all current thinking on the safety of consumers and in order to coordinate the civil society , in particular the society successfully made its views felt in Seattle and elsewhere , indicates worried about food quality and food safety , could the Commission does not take initiative to organize a forum for broad debate , on the other hand , responsible parties , the Commission , government representatives and members of parliament , of course , but also representatives of civil society , NGOs , consumer organizations and professionals involved in the field , so as to ensure that these discussions will filter the citizens of Europe ?
Would you be in favor of establishing a forum like this ?
I can confirm that there are a number of proposals being prepared in relation to the very thing that you can pay attention to .
For example , my service is currently finalizing its framework document for public health , and in that document is a reference to the establishment of public forum in which issues relating to public health , and , consequently , food and consumer goods , things you need to pay attention to , is to be discussed .
I am concerned that the involvement of civil society in the things that you are talking about , especially in the trade .
I also participated in the WTO negotiations in Seattle , the purpose of which is to promote the ideas you refer to , that is the participation and providing the voice of civil society , NGOs and consumers in general discussions surrounding the whole issue of the WTO .
So I can assure you , Auroi that I 'm worried about these things .
I think it is important that you should contact the work of the Commission and civil society , and of course this is something that the Directorate - General , of which I have the honor to be the leader , is closely involved .
I take this responsibility seriously , and we will be moving along in this way .
Mr President , if you want to export of products banned in the Community , you have examined and calculated how many jobs will be lost as a result of Europe ?
Has this been agreed with trade unions and employers ' organizations ?
I must emphasize , Madam President and Members of Parliament , that my responsibility in the field of health and consumer protection .
I have stated on several occasions , including in this House , that priority must be protection of the public .
In circumstances where there may be a conflict of consumers , in particular , their health and their finances , public health , of course , is a top priority .
That 's not to say that the considerations that you should pay attention to take into consideration .
They can not , but in any conflict situation , where you have to choose one or the other , to public health , it is always a top priority .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Commission on this initiative , which I think is very important .
However , I would like the Commissioner to explain how we can take such an initiative against the background of the common agricultural policy , which is completely contrary to contribute to food safety and quality ?
As the common agricultural policy basically pay for the production , and is based solely on quantitative criteria , ie the production level , and because farmers receive money according to how much they produce , how can we accept the Directive thus our first CAP policy is based on quality , which is based on food safety ?
Or is this just a way to deal with public opinion , because the public is increasingly suspicious of the food chain ? We can not change public opinion on the night of the agricultural policy .
Why not start by changing agricultural policy so that it evokes complete trust of consumers ?
I would like to say that the provisions contained in this legislative documents relating to food works as long as the general food law begins to operate .
You will be aware that our plans , which are outlined in the White Paper on Food Safety , includes a provision to introduce legislation in respect of the general food law , and there are many other provisions contained in the White Paper , which is designed to protect food safety , and addressing consumers .
Modernization of the law , of course , it is necessary to have detailed consultations with other Commission and , in particular , Commissioner Fischler , who is responsible for the CAP.
I believe that there is not , and there may be a conflict between the concerns related to the development of agriculture and the concerns related to food safety .
Mr President , I would also like to say how much of the Commission are pleased me today .
However , I would like to live a point for reasons of transparency , such as yourself , I also Commissioner of the view that transparency is directly and substantially related to the public 's confidence in food safety .
However , you mentioned the concept of " confidentiality " in the context of transparency , and I would like to ask you , if this concept of " confidentiality " begins and ends , because I think this is the most sensitive point , if we are to win back the trust of the citizens of Europe .
This provision applies to transparency , and as I mentioned in the presentation to you earlier , we believe the Commission that in line with the general policy , citizens have a right to know the actual risks to which they are exposed , and what steps can be taken to protect them .
As I mentioned limitation to this is the obligation of professional secrecy or confidentiality is defined under Article 287 , except in cases where there is an overriding public health into account .
Thus , the provisions of Article 287 is in the background .
Thus , both the Treaty and the legislation that is brought forward this afternoon to deal with a situation that you can identify and provide adequate and full protection for consumers and full transparency .
I also want to say that I completely agree that consumer confidence is best to improve the provision of full information .
Transparency is very important in this respect and no fear among consumers that some information is retained by the tremendous damage to consumer confidence .
I am very aware of this issue , and that is why I completely agree with the import of your question .
Mr President , Commissioner .
Food safety , product safety - I would like to dwell on the matter .
We know that meat production begins to stall .
Discussion is currently a total of notification feed .
We have also seen that the feed industry has gone directly to the defensive , because they say that what is asked of them here is unrealistic .
My question is : how can we protect the farmers as producers , if in the end they do not know what they feed the animals and then held accountable ?
You ask how we can best protect the farmers as producers , when they do not know what it is that they are feeding their animals .
There is a body of law that deals with animal feed , and the White Paper on this issue is also addressed .
There are provisions in the Annex a document showing that the Commission 's intentions in relation to animal feed .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the members of this important directive , which , as he himself says , is to restore consumer confidence .
The Commissioner is certainly aware of the fact that the Belgian public opinion has been quite a knocking and consumer confidence has fallen in the wake of the dioxin crisis .
I would like to ask the specific question of the rapid alert system .
Said committee of inquiry blamed the Belgian Government , the authorities are responsible , that is , is too slow to implement the system .
This met with the response that the rapid alert system procedures are not very user - friendly , nor is it very clear when exactly the alarm is raised .
Is the Commissioner can not give assurances that these new proposals will help to solve this problem ?
You are absolutely right , what you said about informing the Belgian authorities with regard to dioxin issue .
It was quite a considerable delay at that time which was a concern for everyone , not just the Commission , but apparently also in Parliament .
It was so worried about the Commission that the proceedings were instituted against the Commission of the Belgian courts .
That the dispute will remain in place , even if other aspects of a particular problem that you pick up is resolved , because the delay in reporting , particularly in this case , the relevant authorities and the European Union .
Maybe I could continue with the second aspect of my presentation to Parliament this afternoon , which deals with the proposal for the introduction of BSE tests , and I have the pleasure to present to Parliament this afternoon .
I have expressed on many occasions that I like the new rapid post mortem tests to be one of the most important tools in our efforts to control BSE .
The Commission services are working on a proposal to introduce these tests BSE monitoring program throughout the Community in recent years since September .
The tests will provide new opportunities to test a large number of animals routinely .
The active monitoring program carried out in Switzerland have shown that the rapid post - mortem tests can significantly improve the efficiency of the BSE surveillance program , in particular , the allocation of the dead animal farms or sent for emergency slaughter .
Since 1998 , the Community of BSE surveillance program based on the examination of animals with clinical symptoms suggestive of BSE .
Compared with the current follow - up , the sample size grows twenty - five to one - hundred times in each Member State depending on the size of cattle .
I expect that the proposed new monitoring can be significantly better knowledge of BSE in the Community as we have at the moment .
I am also pleased to tell the House that these certain tests produce results within 24 hours .
We propose to test the minimum number of 65 000 animals per year throughout the Community , and testing will begin in January 2001 .
The proposed decision is not in itself impact on the Community budget , but it is something that deals with specialist veterinary convened next week .
I recommend these proposals to the Parliament , which opened in the afternoon .
Mr President , Commissioner , it comes as no surprise to you that I am not satisfied .
I have a lot of questions .
Parliament has called on the BSE test to be made mandatory as the BSE surveillance committee .
I 've asked you time and time again for some time : you do not like to do the test mandatory as late as January 2001 too little and far too late , because of the BSE tests was estimated a year ago ?
Do you also think , Byrne , that when dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview , or to carry out the screening , testing one animal that five , six , or ten thousand to be slaughtered , depending on the BSE status of Member States ?
Mr Byrne , if the only reason for poor Commission 's proposal is the unwillingness of Member States to agree on , are you ready to tell the House that the Member States have adopted a more ambitious proposal ?
This proposal , as I have said , the SVC will be put before the next week or so , and assuming that the agreement there , it makes the system much more quickly than planned .
In the event that there is no clear agreement , then , of course , appropriate procedures , which have been provided have been complied with , is to go through the Council of Agriculture , and so on .
Then , of course , the systems will be introduced in Member States for this to happen , so that the days that I have put in this are , as a conservative estimate .
It may well be that it can happen in a shorter period of time .
In addition , several Member States have already indicated that they intend to make their own tests at Member State level , and it may well be that we are going to be the subject of the use of these systems in a shorter period of time .
One must always bear in mind , however , that a system such as this requires not only the provisions should be implemented , but the technical details are also provided .
The tests must be available to ensure that the systems , which will be implemented will be monitored and it is working properly .
All of this is put in place to ensure that we get the best results from the work that has been done and expenses that have been incurred .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have already partially answered the first question of the samples .
I have another question .
I am convinced that in view of the consumer , we would be taken more seriously if the producers would have to give up the slaughter of animals in danger and if we had the same law throughout the Community .
Another point , the Commissioner , as regards the application in 2001 .
I think it is imperative that in addition to , inter alia , to terminate the emergency slaughter of sick animals , so that only the real victims are subject to emergency slaughter .
Control would then be much tighter industry , which will benefit consumers .
We know that there is a proposal out there already , and that now take place quickly .
I hope that this matter be discussed at the Agriculture Council meeting in June estimated that the concerns of emerging issues .
Commissioner , we are particularly concerned because the decision that has been made does not seem to be sufficiently correct answer to the anxiety of consumers .
Testing is not systematic or limited to sick animals or dead farm animals , and so we have no way to give the impression of the adoption of the almost systematic , and therefore reliable , attitudes towards meat quality and epidemiological policies that could be implemented .
You have just said that the public health is a top priority for employment and economic considerations .
Do you not think that in this case concerns the cost of vaccines and money are priority for the interests of consumers ?
This particular proposal is aimed at , as you say , sick animals and animals that have been slaughtered as a result of an emergency , but it is not only directed at those .
The reason why it is directed to these animals is due to the fact that is where we are likely to get the best and most accurate information .
In addition , it must be borne in mind that there are proposals for the removal of specified risk material , which adds another layer of safety for consumers .
In addition , you are aware of the proposals , which are in existence relating to the control feed containing meat and bone meal .
All of these factors must be considered together .
It is not only one of the proposals that we present to you this afternoon to be the only answer to the consumer with regard to the consumption of beef .
There is a multi - layered response , there are many things involved , and I have found some of them to you this afternoon .
I want to assure you that there is an attempt to ensure the best possible protection for consumers in the consumption of all food , including beef .
My question to you , Mr Commissioner , is this : so far , thank God , Austria has not been a single case of BSE .
Can these tests will also be carried out in Austria ?
Yes , these tests are carried out in all Member States , including Austria .
Only in carrying out these tests in all Member States , we can be the kind of security , which we believe is necessary .
Many of you have spoken about the need to put before any other consumer protection , food safety and public health , and in these circumstances , the system that we have developed for the tests have to leave on the grounds that to acquire the most valuable and accurate information is necessary to carry out tests on the entire European Union .
Only in order to concentrate the minds of the Member States , we can ask what the Commission and the size of the SVC , are made as a result of the tests , which are made in Switzerland with regard to the number of animals , either the number or proportion of those who have entered the human food chain ?
I have to say that I can not read the mind SVC , but this question is going before the SVC next week , and of course I will contribute to the representatives of all the arguments that I have advanced to you this afternoon .
You , Whitehead , are particularly familiar with these .
I expect and hope that the proposals are welcome SVC and does not need suggestions then go ahead Agriculture Council meeting .
I hope that we get a good reception , and I believe that in the phone book that we have had in some Member States , there is a real fear in relation to these questions , not least because of the finding of a single case in Denmark recently .
I just have a small question to add to what Mr Daul and Lienemann have already said . What can be done ?
Would not it make sense to eliminate the animals are moved to the slaughterhouse at the last minute , which are often likely to be infected ?
My understanding is that the animals usually taken out of the food chain .
My question relates to Byrne of the last report Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin BSE in France .
The findings make extremely alarming reading .
Several French departments - I think about 23 departments - is apparently followed the BSE cattle strains departments , even if they were sections where the large number of dairy cattle .
Conditions and controls in slaughterhouses were such that one came to the conclusion in the report that it is entirely possible today , on 29 March 2000 , that the animals continue to BSE from entering the food chain in France .
This is of great concern to the Commissioner .
I took this with the French Minister of Agriculture , Mr GLAVANY , when he came to Brussels last week .
He rejected outright the conclusions of Food and Veterinary Office of the report and findings of the inspectors .
I would like to know what the Commission is doing this .
I understand that my question is rather , caused by agriculture commissioner , but Byrne is responsible for food safety , and clearly there is a risk to food safety in France , where the findings of Food and Veterinary Office accepted .
Could I therefore ask Byrne , what will he do with this report ?
This particular report came as a result of the inspection , which took place in June last year .
Following on from that the report had to be written and evaluated and discussed with the French authorities .
This was done in the autumn and I am sure that the problems that the attention of the French authorities that exercise is treated much the answers of the French authorities .
I have to say , in relation to the reports Food and Veterinary Office , that I have discussed with them in reports and we are currently working on how reports are made , how they are written and what information they contain .
I was in a seminar in Dublin on the last weekend to discuss these issues in the veterinary Heads of the European Union and the Food and Veterinary Office .
We have made a number of suggestions and I am convinced that when these proposals are in place , we have met with Member States ' concerns in relation to this and also , of course , take into account the concerns of consumers .
I would also like to draw attention to the fact that , recently , Mr. GLAVANY French Minister of Agriculture announced its intention to introduce about 40 000 tests for the type that I have discussed with you here this afternoon to determine the levels of infectivity of BSE and France .
Aeroplane " hushkits
Hatzidakis on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism Committee Hushkitted air ( B 5-0018 / 2000 ) ;
Jackson , on behalf on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the Hushkit question ( B 5-0020 / 2000 ) .
Mr President , I look forward to the Commission 's reply to the debate .
The first question you want to ask the question : is the Financial Times this morning , the exact prediction of the Commissioner is about to answer our questions by saying that the only part of the Noise Regulation shall enter into force , part of the accession to the European Union on May 4 .
We believe that the commissioner is going to say is that part relating to third countries , which should come into force in 2002 , does not come into force , and in fact suspended .
The Environment Committee is the competent committee of the European Parliament for the original regulation of aircraft noise and we have watched with some amazement that the reluctance of the adoption of the United States , the European Union has its rights to require that option into force on the due date .
In the background is our point of view , continued prevarication side of the United States administration whose attitude is , in the past given us sufficient guarantees that they are ready to negotiate seriously with ICAO to find a way out of our problems .
Committee on the Environment requires that we have the full right , because of the proximity of a large number of European airports population centers , trying to get lower noise levels of aircraft landing in Europe , where they come from and who works for them .
Europeans should certainly be able to make laws , because they want to protect the European population , and give them the highest possible protection against noise .
To put it in its crudest form , how do we explain the situation for European citizens if , after 2002 , they have yet to hear a noisy old machines from third countries , with hushkits we judge insufficient , clanging round our skies ?
This is obviously a difficult thing to discuss rationally the United States election year .
We can understand that American politicians have little room for maneuver .
I think , however , that the Commissioner may be about to inform us that the light is dawning and that we can see the way forward , which will help both parties will be satisfied and will continue to provide meaningful negotiations with a global solution .
The first compromise made a short time ago seemed to many in this House is just too shaky .
In fact , the European Union had suspended the entire setting , and then the United States would have postponed the appeal of the ICAO and the negotiations would have gone forward .
Danger , we felt , was the fact that the European Union would not have been anything .
We look forward to what the Commission has to say , and I must emphasize that it is very important that he should meet the Environment Committee and the Parliament , not least because , if he asks us to suspend the application of any part of the regulation , it will have to come to Parliament through the co - decision procedure .
Mr President , as has become clear , we asked this question , because of Regulation ( EC ) No 925/99 to reduce aircraft noise has come into force very soon , in the meantime , the discussions between de Palacio and the USA , who has found the setting , which was adopted by the Council and Parliament , disturbing and calls for its abolition and suspension .
As is clear , the regulation was adopted in order to protect the environment and the public .
At the same time , however , it seems that the setting affects the interests of the American aircraft industry .
To show good faith , the Council and the European Parliament postponed the entry into force of the Regulation , for one year .
Despite the positive attitude , the Americans , in turn , have shown supreme arrogance in particular the European Parliament where as I said earlier , the setting may be canceled first , and then , as a slight concession , talked about the suspension until further notice .
The time came when it seemed that progress has been made , although there anything that could be considered satisfactory , but in the end even that little progress has been lost in recent days , as the USA has applied to the ICAO under Article 84 of the Chicago Convention , the Treaty on European Union Regulation , the purpose of which , as I said , is to protect the environment .
For our part , we want to make it absolutely clear that we do not have any desire to create tensions with the United States . We do not want a trade war , we do not want problems in our relations , and we consider them as allies and friends .
Our position is therefore as follows :
secondly , if there is no agreement , then it is clear that the European Union must act unilaterally ;
Third , we believe that the role of the United States , which calls for the withdrawal of the Regulation or until the suspension of its implementation is completely unacceptable ;
Fifth , we are opposed to further delaying the entry into force of the Regulation of the aircraft of the Member States , and this is why we consider the question of internal and we can not keep Americans competent to determine what we do in our own aircraft ,
and the sixth , we are ready to review the Regulation ( EC ) No 925/99 aircraft registered in third countries , provided , however , that in the meantime an agreement is reached in ICAO new standards .
If there is good faith , that the agreement can become a reality .
At the same time , however , there is no need to suspend the regulation of third - country aircraft , for the simple reason that the Regulation applies to the air shall enter into force only in 2002 .
In that sense , I do not understand the request of the United States , who continually talk about the suspension of its own regulation .
And of course , we believe the United States should withdraw a petition under Article 84 of the ICAO Chicago Convention , as such an action is blowing a spirit of cooperation clouds .
Mr President , I would like to make two observations .
The first is this : it must be made clear who is negotiating with the United States side .
We know who our negotiator is , it is de Palacio , and so far he has proven to be a very good negotiator .
What the other side , it is not clear who is negotiator .
This prevents us from having a stable position in the United States , and it is also empty on their own .
The second observation is this : The United States must realize that the European Parliament is no longer the body it used to be , in previous decades .
So they need to understand that , in addition , they must also address the Parliament and take its views very seriously , because without Parliament can not be made .
These ideas , which is why I would like to ask the Commission and the Council what their positions are .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one thing is crystal clear : May 4 , modified airplanes Regulation shall enter into force in the European Union .
That is , all we know for sure .
Since then , we have to look at how we can continue to negotiate with the United States .
Purpose of this regulation is very clear : to the above what has been agreed within the ICAO , in other words , that the land at our airports genuinely meet the noise standards of ICAO .
This setting is no longer the intention , but I think we need to be more ambitious .
The existing standards , such as Blokland pointed out , date from 1978 .
Since then the world of aeronautical technology has made great progress .
Today the existing air noise levels can sometimes be 20 , 40 or even 50 times lower than older aircraft .
So the question is to achieve new levels of noise international standards of ICAO .
In this respect , we have to cooperate with the Americans , who , after all , are our friends and allies .
The fact that this Regulation shall enter into force soon does not mean that we do not need to continue the negotiations with the Americans in order to improve the situation of the noise standards of ICAO .
We can negotiate two things :
First of all , we are going to reach for a higher level of international standards within the framework of the ICAO , we are going to cooperate with ICAO and we are going to strive for a common goal , which is to reduce noise at airports even further and thus achieve a lower noise level , the application of more modern technology , which provides for transitional periods for the most noisy air through the establishment of chapter 4 .
Second , Americans have suspended their appeal ICAO in accordance with Article 84 , and we - this is something we can negotiate - to suspend part of the regulation , which applies to third - country airlines ; but certainly not with reference to European airlines as that Regulation shall enter into force on 4 May .
In other words , having regard to the airlines , there is nothing more to say : we can only negotiate with the airlines of third countries - of which we have some leeway until 2002 - and we should suspend that part .
It is clear that when we come to a new agreement within ICAO , Community standards adapted to the new ICAO standards , which in any case is better than that provided for in the existing provisions .
I have consulted many people in the United States government .
The only problem is that what is needed - and I hope that at some point we will get it - is not only talks , but also a confirmation that the preliminary agreements with the special negotiator 's responsibility to get the support of the American administration .
I thought of you immediately and completely transparent in all this time .
I 'm not going to expand on what steps have been , because you are completely familiar with them .
The agreement could possibly be reached on the basic ideas of which I presented to him , and we will continue to work .
Only if you are agree with the other aspects I had come to ask the House to support the moratorium in respect of third country airlines and the interruption of a rule in this particular case .
I hope that , in all , we can reach a consensus .
Mr President , I have started my speech with the title of Shakespeare 's play , " Much Ado About Nothing " , but unfortunately , it would be totally inappropriate .
There is a lot of noise a lot .
However , I am reluctant to put things a little more in the right context , which may be disassociating myself a little bit Chairman of the Presidency of the Council , the point is : we 're not talking about the environment here , which I am otherwise quite pleased to discuss , as you well know , we 're talking about health .
What we are discussing today has very little to do with the law on traffic or the environment ; On the contrary , we legislate to protect people .
Every scientist in the world , including the United States , was established in recent years that the noise makes people sick .
The noise makes people sick , and , therefore , not only injures and stresses the people themselves , it also causes damage to the whole community , ie the national economy .
It is something that many of us want to remember , which is why we left this legislation .
It 's the only reason .
This is what we want to remember , regardless of the fact that , otherwise , we are of course always happy to integrate transport policy with other policies and environmental policies on road safety .
The legislation is in force , as all have said here today , and commendably , the Commissioner also again said clearly .
Recently , I listened to you , Mrs de Palacio , I was most impressed with the very clear , very logical and very decisive way for you to care about it .
Legislation is in force and that is why I am wondering what the Council of Transport Ministers discussed yesterday .
Basically , it does not have anything to discuss , unless it wants to propose a new law for us , which of course is not the case .
De Palacio said in the past that he needs the support of Parliament at some point in the second part of the Regulation relating to part of the third countries , including the United States , South America and Eastern Europe , ie all countries outside the European Union .
It is the part that is due to come into force in April 2002 .
But if you approach us , de Palacio and want us to postpone this part , then I think you should offer us more than you currently have , as you well know .
If you go back and negotiate , one thing must be made clear , and I hope and believe that Parliament is quite clear on this issue : it is clear that we need insurance unambiguous standards .
We need to be clear and consistent manner where we want to go and what the ultimate goal is .
I 'm not bargaining for more than six months , but I want to clear objectives and we must have a clear schedule .
If - and I say this now , completely unofficially , that I will be in a table written debate - if , instead , that in April 2002 , it was September 2002 , or even january 2003 I would be the last to make a song and dance about it , but I want a clear , binding timetable to be followed for all parties involved , including the United States .
When we have all this , so I would like to see it go through the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization , ICAO , in September .
If it goes through September of next year , so we still have enough time to interrupt the Regulation .
I 'm not ready to consider the suspension without conditions just formulated .
If this is the case , however , what you come to us , then it is possible , but it has to go through the ordinary legislative procedure and you need to Parliament support - even though the United States need to understand that - and then maybe we can stop at the end of the day the second play that Shakespeare could have been called " No noise no " !
Mr President , Mr President , Commissioner , I think it is a shame that you had to invest so much time and energy on this issue because , as Mr Blokland said , we spend all of our time looking back orders century instead of the future .
They have not given us a commitment that makes us so suspicious .
They have given it to us so often . There are so many times they have committed half and then back again , and so on and so forth .
As far as I 'm concerned , it is clear that the suspicion is based on the American reluctance to engage in something that is inevitable .
Only when they actually sign on the dotted line this Union , we can help move the situation .
It seemed to me at this meeting that the joint to ourselves , Mr. Slater is of the opinion that the hush kits are a matter of secondary importance which stands in the way a lot of important things , and that we need to put this thing in bed quickly as possible .
But there is a huge amount of doubt on their side too .
And so I believe that it is time for a clear sign ; but it must come from them in the first place .
What do we want to hear about them is that they want to find a solution , not behind closed doors somewhere , but officially on paper .
Their commitment to the future depends on whether we are willing to stay .
Hatzidakis has said that it should be withdrawn and you said that we should defer .
I have tabled an amendment according to which they should definitely withdraw the complaint .
I think we have a word of what we currently have on paper a little bit stronger .
What is worthy of admiration , I think , Commissioner , that you are currently on the same lines as the Parliament and it would seem the Council .
Thus , in my opinion , our position is stronger than the Americans at this time , and we must do everything we can to make things as far as possible .
Mr President , I think the Commissioner Palacio is fully entitled to defend the position against the United States .
This is not the first time that our laws and regulations are different from those of the United States . Consider , for example , genetically modified organisms .
Now I feel that the question is not what equipment should be used in aircraft to reduce noise , and standardized procedures exist to regulate aircraft noise , but the most important thing is the noise limits shall not be exceeded .
It does not matter whether this is achieved by using a modified afterburners or other engine silencers .
It is important that the limits that have been set to protect the communities are respected and that they are enforced by the competent bodies .
Mr President , the Vice - President , Mr President , Mr President , I am pleased that we are here together today , after all the discussions in recent months , and can confirm that all three institutions - the two legislative institutions and the Commission proposal to the relevant authority - consider that Regulation should enter into force in May this year .
Any other course would be possible , because there is no legislative process , which is fast enough so that the new changes will be made in May .
What matters is our opinion that the noise reduction settings are correct for our people , that we must protect people from the vicinity of airports , and that the interests of the United States is in no case affected so far .
The vested interests of American companies may be affected , but the setting will not take effect for aircraft registered in third countries by the year 2002 , which is why we have to bite our tongue a little bit and choose our words carefully , Mr President .
I wonder if we should remove this option so far as third - country aircraft concerned .
It does not even come into force .
It is on the statute books , but not enter into force until May 2002 .
I think we should start the legislative procedure at the end of the year .
When you have reached global standards of ICAO working groups , we can begin to accept these global standards in our setting , to the extent that it applies to third - country aircraft for the year 2002 .
If , during the legislative process , which lasts six months or a year , we get an indication of September that these requirements have been introduced in the General Assembly of ICAO as they are , we can conclude the legislative process well before May 2002 .
This was also what my colleague asked .
We should not start the legislative procedure under the title " pause " , but entitled " Adapting to the new , jointly - agreed standards . "
In this regard , I believe that Mr. Slater should put his money where his mouth is , as we say in Hamburg .
It is not enough for him to say that he wants to agree with us ; as Vice - President has called him to do over again , he will also tell you what the noise reduction quality standards he wants to agree .
On this basis , Mr Vice - President , you still have our full support .
We admire you , as the Council has gone to the attack time and again , saying you should draw up a legislative proposal immediately and give in to the Americans .
You rightly said , the Americans are our friends , but we do not tighten when it comes to their own environmental protection .
Stand by your guns , Vice - President !
But I would advise that we expect the first working day of the results of the ICAO working group noise abatement regulations .
Then we can start to sound the legislative process , the interests of all citizens , as we want global standards that are more stringent that those we have had in the past .
Mr President , Mrs Roth - Behrendt quoted Shakespeare for his contribution and I would like to quote Hamlet 's soliloquy : is it nobler to suffer the slings and arrows outrageous fortune , or by opposing end them .
Chairman of the United States delegation here in this House , I am only too well aware of the many slings and arrows outrageous fortune , which constitute the trade disputes between the EU and the United States of America .
But having said that , it is important to get every trade dispute with respect .
Each of us would like to welcome small indication of progress that comes after meetings with Foreign Minister Slater and Ambassador Morningstar .
I say this knowing full well the massive pressures is when Congress in an election year .
I do not want to be too critical , we know only too well the parliamentarians about the election of pressure , but it is worth to say that the pressures of the United States is not so much the citizens , from the voters , but the big business backers of both parties and both campaigns and that makes a huge difference .
I do not go through all of them again , but only to say that it is not only necessary to agree on a schedule strict noise standards also agree on a schedule which they should be implemented .
Roth - Behrendt is mentioned objective , with whom I am going to agree with you .
I want to make one other brief comment , because this dispute highlights the need for earlier and more candid discussions on many issues , where there are disagreements .
Relations with the United States is planning , as you probably know , the Transatlantic Legislators ' Dialogue , using video conferencing technologies , so that we can discuss and understand - and clearly Americans need to understand - what is Parliament 's powers are positive and also negative powers of the authority and the importance of timing in our joint negotiations .
Mr President , I support the resolutions that are before us . I do not do it just because it is important to hushkits to the point , though should not underestimate the huge inconvenience and a very real and significant health effects from noise , but also because it establishes the principle according to which Europe sets its own regional standards .
Aircraft silencers is also widely seen as a first example of how aviation issues dealt with in the future a new Parliament and a new Commission .
It is very clear that the ICAO standards must be kept on the floor , not the ceiling .
It should be perfectly possible and legal to go further .
It is about how we practice , the Treaty of Amsterdam sustainability considerations into all policy areas , even in very difficult .
I wonder if we can use this conflict and these negotiations with the United States to take a broader discussion about proactive global environmental policy , air transport in general .
Hush kits are important , but noise pollution is only one part of the environmental damage caused by air travel .
It is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and we know it is clearly untenable .
We need to extend a new policy to deal with all these issues .
Mr President , I have problems with Genesis Regulation 925 1999 , to which the resolution refers .
It was voted through last Parliament without debate .
It is contrary to the principle of non - discrimination .
It violates the basic requirement of Article 253 , as well as establishing that there is no explanation at all setting off the bypass ratio aircraft engine internationally accepted criteria for noise and emissions certification of aircraft engines already exists .
It is contrary to the principle of proportionality and , most importantly , it is contrary to WTO rules that require performance standards , not design standards , as is the case in this Regulation .
In whose interest is it to depart from this piece of legislation accelerated the tried and tested procedures and practices , in which the performance criteria of environmental standards ?
This legislation rolls out a proposal made by Airbus , Airbus host a meeting in Toulouse on 29 and 30 September and 1 October 1997 , effectively commercially sponsored legislation .
At this meeting , members of the European Civil Aviation Organization Council ( ECAC ) reported the presence of their legal advisers , that they can not proceed under the ICAO agreement requested by Airbus and Airbus persuaded the Commission to provide a ECAC could not .
We now have legislation that threatens another transatlantic trade war - but it 's another thing - who does not respect the environment in terms of best practice criteria and which - surprise , surprise - closes the air , using the modern U.S. made the engine again to continue to use the Rolls Royce engine , which is conveniently bypass ratio of 3.1 .
Yes , Mr President , noise pollution affects 20 % of our population , and 0.01 % comes from the air .
I fully support the standards required to protect the health and quality of life of our citizens .
The strictest possible criteria for noise and emissions from aircraft engines can only be achieved , however , by using the performance criteria and not design a commercially supported and accelerated by anti - competitive legislation .
Environmental legislation is based on the design criteria , I put it to you colleagues , is without precedent , and for good reason .
I would ask in relation to the Commission in the interests of fairness , to satisfy himself completely to the history of this Regulation in question in order to ensure how the roll - out of the aviation industry worldwide .
I do not care whether it 's in America , Europe , China or Mars - the world is fair .
Above all , it should serve as a very important environmental objectives it claims to achieve .
I fully support the objective of the Regulation and must agree on a timetable to implement noise standards , but it must be based on performance criteria and not design .
The integrity of Parliament calls for detailed answers to questions that raise serious doubts about aspects of the Regulation , which is based on the motion before us , and which asked to vote tomorrow .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that Mr Doyle did not examine the legislative history of the real situation , because we have discussed this issue on several occasions in this House .
I can not imagine Madame Doyle , that the Council was unanimous and the House almost unanimously , adopt a decision based solely on the Airbus defense .
No , there are thousands living in the vicinity of airports that suffer significant noise pollution .
Apparently , this setting gives them the best protection than the current situation of the current international law .
Second , the Palacio de Coelho 's my opinion of the suspension was of no use for the simple reason that American interests - and when I say American interests mean interests of one section of American industry - are clearly advantages , which are contrary to the general improvement in standards , even more so modified airplanes .
There are only two things that will cause them to move : the pressure of the European Union or the pressure of its own public , unfortunately , the United States is a large area and the environs of airports are less badly affected than areas overflown in Europe , that is , because of its geographical layout , become seriously ill such constraints .
American opinion will therefore only shifted considerably , in turn , if we first make known our capacity Europeans .
My unfortunate that this year deferral may be seen as partners demonstrated the weakness of our position .
There is no justification for the suspension orders .
We could at best to check them , but we can do it only in one case : if an international agreement allows to improve the situation and draw up a general framework agreement .
The general framework does not mean to get around the problem , as I began to doubt hear the Council 's perspective .
We actually all agree on the idea that the framework agreement should be subject to standards for noise levels and should try to cover too broad an area that would try to force us to accept a number of compromises in the noise level at the expense of some other pollution , which is likely to be worthy of attention , but not so much as to warrant our ceding our argument .
Mr President , Commissioner , as you know , I live in the city of Bilbao in the Basque Country , as in other European cities , it is very densely populated .
Our airport is very close to the residential and commercial , as 20 % of all European citizens , we suffer from noise levels of aircraft which health experts consider to be unacceptable .
On 29 April 1999 the European Union adopted a Council Regulation , the purpose of which is to limit and reduce the noise produced by subsonic aircraft engines , by limiting in time the use of silencers , which do not solve the problem completely , and helps airlines to upgrade the fleet with a new generation of airplanes pollute less .
This is displeased with a powerful American companies , such as aircraft manufacturers , but at the same time damaging them , because they are also the owner - investors of thousands of leased aircraft in all countries of the world . Since these antiquated aircraft , it would be difficult for them to operate in Europe .
Similarly , the setting was a popular American manufacturers of aircraft engines called silencers modified airplanes and , therefore , the United States has announced the commercial , financial , etc. measures of the European Union if we postpone our legislation comes into force .
I understand that we must be inflexible . We have to provide an opportunity for dialogue and understanding , but in order for that to happen , the United States must agree to adopt certain approaches .
The following assembly of ICAO , the United States is committed to adoption of the new and more stringent standard for aircraft noise , as well as to recant and coercive measures .
Only under these conditions can we accept delays in our legislation for third countries .
Mr President , the British representative was speaking right to the use of Bowen 's talk time .
I would be more than pleased to introduce him to the documents I received the Commissioner de Palacio , which weakens his story to make him re - think them , and in order to avoid bringing his whole Parliament into disrepute .
I think , Mr Blokland , you could have done that without really communicate it to the Parliament , but it does not matter .
Mr President , like most of the other speakers here , I see no reason at all any kind of immediate suspension or emergency suspension of Hushkit regulations .
There are options , we put them in place .
I was here first reading in Parliament in Strasbourg .
There were not very many of us here , much less than today , when we introduced these settings the first place .
They are good options . There are going to be useful settings and they 're going to bring a positive benefit to European citizens .
This does not mean , however , that you should not negotiate .
I was lucky to have the opportunity to discuss the Under - Secretary Slater yesterday with a number of my other colleagues .
They seem to be reasonable people who would be willing to speak intelligently with you about better long - term solution .
We know there are better long - term solutions , because we know the regulation applies only in Europe .
While it may have repercussions for the not too distant future , to third countries , we do not take the world - wide effect .
My goal is to get Madame Palacio , the world will have an impact .
Your objective is to make absolutely sure that what you come up with the agreement with the Americans to secure a new global monitoring of aircraft noise out of the ICAO clear timetable .
It 's not just a question of agreeing to controls and levels , but also the timetable for implementation , which makes us happy and satisfied in Parliament .
It is the mandate we give you here today . That 's what we 'd like to see you come back at some point in the future .
In the meantime , however , to monitor and implement the rules we expect to be complied with and implemented .
Tell the Americans that if they want to talk to a climate of trust and goodwill , the first thing they can do is to postpone the Article 84 complaint ICAO .
They do not need to cancel it , they do not have to take it off , they just have to make sure that it does not go to the agenda of the next meeting .
Suggest that to them , Madame Palacio .
To start negotiations and then come back to us with a reasonable compromise .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank all of you for your speeches and in particular the Portuguese Minister of Transport , Chairman of the Presidency of the Council .
Yesterday we talked about it and I got the full support of the Council , of which I would like to publicly thank .
Ladies and gentlemen , it should be clear that our goal must not be modified airplanes comply with the regulation , so that the regulation silencers .
Setup to mufflers means nothing more than the implementation of noise levels in 1978 and we are in the year 2000 .
We have to come to an agreement with ICAO , to this end , the support and cooperation is essential to the United States .
We need to get beyond has been reactive behavior , ie , behavior that has been working in the operating principle of the reaction , and move towards an approach that is ambitious and looking to the future .
In this regard , there are two things we should discuss : a national perspective , we need to talk communication on aviation and the environment , which the Minister Coelho referred to , which we discussed yesterday in the Council and with many other things , with the exception of simply noise , such as emissions , and a number of other issues .
As far as the United States , we have to try to find a form of cooperation that goes far beyond the existing cooperation between ICAO .
We need to try to create a common transatlantic aviation sector , which is a regional area , is able to increase the integration of markets on both sides of the Atlantic , as it is a geographical area with a similar level of development and with the highest air traffic in the world .
It is clear , tensions and clashes with modified airplanes question to prevent this type of activity .
Efforts should be made to reach an agreement that allows us to overcome the current situation of conflict .
I want to make it clear that the Regulation shall enter into force mufflers , May 4 , European airlines .
There is nothing to say .
We have suggested to the Americans that if they consider that the concept of " by - pass ratio is a form of discrimination - and we feel that it is not - that we try to find a different definition .
However , the United States did not want to do this type of discussion .
This Regulation shall enter into force for European airlines , May 4 .
However , ladies and gentlemen , if we could reach an agreement with the United States to work together in order to obtain a lower and more requirements in terms of noise emissions from airplanes , I would be willing to put forward a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council , may suspend the provisions of the current Regulation in relation to third countries .
As Mr Sterckx said , we have to overcome all the mutual distrust , we must overcome situations of confrontation and I think the gesture of this type , if supported by the United States of not only commitment but also the withdrawal , or even the suspension of Article 84 of the ICAO Convention , it would be valuable if in return , we manage to move forward together to achieve better international standards which can also be applied here in Europe , and that allows us to go much further than we can go to this Regulation , mufflers at the moment .
Thank you very much , Madam President .
I would like to thank you once again for your support and I want to thank the Chairman and President of the Council and of the Council of transport traffic as a whole the answer they gave me yesterday .
I have received a motion for a resolution of the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy to Rule 42 ( 5 ) and the Rules of Procedure .
That concludes the joint debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
